       "['Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.Data science is a \"concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods\" to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.A  data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data.\\n\\n\\n== Foundations ==\\nData science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains. The field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, data visualization, information visualization, data sonification, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business. Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human–computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data. In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationship to statistics ===\\nMany statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics. Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data. Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action. Andrew Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. He describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early usage ===\\nIn 1962, John Tukey described a field he called \"data analysis\", which resembles modern data science. In 1985, in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, C. F. Jeff Wu used the term \"data science\" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics. Later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the University of Montpellier  II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.The term \"data science\" has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science. In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic. However, the definition was still in flux. After the 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in 1997 C. F. Jeff Wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. He reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data. In 1998, Hayashi Chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.During the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included \"knowledge discovery\" and \"data mining\".\\n\\n\\n=== Modern usage ===\\nIn 2012, technologists Thomas H. Davenport and DJ Patil declared \"Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\", a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the New York Times and the Boston Globe. A decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that \"the job is more in demand than ever with employers\".The modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland. In a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name. \"Data science\" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the Committee on Data for Science and Technology launched the Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched The Journal of Data Science. In 2014, the American Statistical Association\\'s Section on Statistical Learning and Data Mining changed its name to the Section on Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.The professional title of \"data scientist\" has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. Though it was used by the National Science Board in their 2005 report \"Long-Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st Century\", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.There is still no consensus on the definition of data science, and it is considered by some to be a buzzword. Big data is a related marketing term. Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations.\\n\\n\\n== Data science and data analysis ==\\nData science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of data management and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an interdisciplinary field that involves the application of statistical, computational, and machine learning methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.Data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between variables. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a data analyst might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.Data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and iterative process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to statistical analysis, data science often involves tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences.While data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.Despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, programming, and data visualization, as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Moreover, both fields benefit from critical thinking and domain knowledge, as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.In summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of data management and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from structured data, while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines statistical analysis, computational methods, and machine learning to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven decision-making. Both fields play vital roles in leveraging the power of data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nOpen Data Science Conference\\nScientific Data\\nWomen in Data\\nPython (programming language)\\nR (programming language)\\nData engineering\\nBig data\\nMachine learning\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
       " 'Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or other living beings. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), interacting via human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of funding. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field\\'s long-term goals.To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning, problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\\n\\n\\n=== Planning and decision making ===\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision making, the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.In some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be.\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.Game theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.\\n\\n\\n=== Learning ===\\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning.There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Natural language processing ===\\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.Early work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning, and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.\\n\\n\\n=== Perception ===\\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.The field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition, and robotic perception.\\n\\n\\n=== Social intelligence ===\\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.\\n\\n\\n=== General intelligence ===\\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== Techniques ==\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.\\n\\n\\n=== Search and optimization ===\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\n\\n==== State space search ====\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help to prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.\\n\\n\\n==== Local search ====\\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).\\n\\n\\n=== Logic ===\\nFormal Logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.\\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")\\nand predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").Logical inference (or deduction) is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are already known to be true (the premises).\\nA logical knowledge base also handles queries and assertions as a special case of inference.\\nAn inference rule describes what is a valid step in a proof. The most general inference rule is resolution.\\nInference can be reduced to performing a search to find a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.\\nInference performed this way is intractable except for short proofs in restricted domains. No efficient, powerful and general method has been discovered.\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.Non-monotonic logics are designed to handle default reasoning.\\nOther specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains (see knowledge representation above).\\n\\n\\n=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===\\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.Bayesian networks\\nare a very general tool that can be used for many problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks)\\nand perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).\\nPrecise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.\\n\\n\\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers\\nare functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.There are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.Neural networks are also used as classifiers.\\n\\n\\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\\nAn Artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns, once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.\\nNeural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.Perceptrons\\nuse only a single layer of neurons, deep learning uses multiple layers.\\nConvolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other – this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.\\n\\n\\n=== Deep learning ===\\nDeep learning\\nuses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification\\nand others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.\\nThe sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)\\nbut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n=== GPT ===\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences (natural language processing). Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet. The pre-training consists in predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pre-training, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world, and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are still prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots which allow you to ask a question or request a task in simple text.Current models and services include: Bard, ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound and text.\\n\\n\\n=== Specialized hardware and software ===\\n\\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training.\\nHistorically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, Python and others, had been used.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple\\'s Face ID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace and Google\\'s FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\\'s iPhoto and TikTok).\\n\\n\\n=== Health and Medicine ===\\n\\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.\\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating Big Data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. \\nIt has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen our understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023 it was reported that AI guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.\\n\\n\\n=== Games ===\\n\\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI\\'s most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then in 2017 it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinfrocement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMind\\'s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021 an AI agent competed in a Playstation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world’s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.\\n\\n\\n=== Military ===\\n\\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.\\nIn November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of IA. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative AI ===\\n\\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. In March 2023, 58% of US adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.\\n\\n\\n=== Industry Specific Tasks ===\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights\" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\\n\\n\\n== Ethics ==\\nAI, like any powerful technology, has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.Anyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs to factor ethics into their AI training processes and strive to avoid bias. This is especially true when using AI algorithms that are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.\\n\\n\\n=== Risks and harm ===\\n\\n\\n==== Privacy and copyright ====\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\\nTechnology companies collect a wide range of data from their users, including online activity, geolocation data, video and audio.\\nFor example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon have recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temps to listen to and transcribe some of them.\\nOpinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, began to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\".Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under a rationale of \"fair use\". Also website owners who do not wish to have their copyrighted content be AI indexed or ‘scraped’ can add code to their site, as you would, if you did not want your website to be indexed by a search engine which is currently available to certain services such as OpenAI. Experts disagree about how well, and under what circumstances, this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.\\n\\n\\n==== Misinformation ====\\n\\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem.\\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.\\n\\n\\n==== Algorithmic bias and fairness ====\\n\\nMachine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data.\\nThe developers may not be aware that the bias exists.\\nBias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.Fairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias. It has become serious area of academic study within AI. Researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define \"fairness\" in a way that satisfies all stakeholders.On June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called \"sample size disparity\". Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist.\\nIn 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".\\nMoritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"Criticism of COMPAS highlighted a deeper problem with the misuse of AI. Machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. Unfortunately, if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022) the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings recommending that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.\\n\\n\\n==== Lack of transparency ====\\n\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.People who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are required to clearly and completely explain the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.DARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try and solve these problems.There are several potential solutions to the transparency problem. SHAP helps visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. LIME can locally approximate a model with a simpler, interpretable model. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.\\n\\n\\n==== Conflict, surveillance and weaponized AI ====\\n\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. These weapons are considered especially dangerous for several reasons: if they kill an innocent person it is not clear who should be held accountable, it is unlikely they will reliably choose targets, and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.AI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.AI facial recognition systems are used for mass surveillance, notably in China. In 2019, Bengaluru, India deployed AI-managed traffic signals. This system uses cameras to monitor traffic density and adjust signal timing based on the interval needed to clear traffic. Terrorists, criminals and rogue states can use weaponized AI such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons. Machine-learning AI is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.\\n\\n\\n==== Technological unemployment ====\\n\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments, for example those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI. A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illlustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n==== Existential risk ====\\n\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\". This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk have expressed concern about existential risk from AI.In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.AI pioneers including Fei-Fei Li, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Cynthia Breazeal, Rana el Kaliouby, Demis Hassabis, Joy Buolamwini, and Sam Altman have expressed concerns about the risks of AI. In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".Other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" Andrew Ng also argued that \"it’s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers’ dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Limiting AI ====\\nPossible options for limiting AI include: using Embedded Ethics or Constitutional AI where companies or governments can add a policy, restricting high levels of compute power in training, restricting the ability to rewrite its own code base, restrict certain AI techniques but not in the training phase, open-source (transparency) vs proprietary (could be more restricted), backup model with redundancy, restricting security, privacy and copyright, restricting or controlling the memory, real-time monitoring, risk analysis, emergency shut-off, rigorous simulation and testing, model certification, assess known vulnerabilities, restrict the training material, restrict access to the internet, issue terms of use.\\n\\n\\n=== Ethical machines and alignment ===\\n\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.\\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,\\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.Other approaches include Wendell Wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"\\nand Stuart J. Russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.\\n\\n\\n=== Frameworks ===\\nArtificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values – developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:\\nRESPECT the dignity of individual people\\nCONNECT with other people sincerely, openly and inclusively\\nCARE for the wellbeing of everyone\\nPROTECT social values, justice and the public interestOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE\\'s Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.\\n\\n\\n=== Regulation ===\\n\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.\\nThe regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.\\nBetween 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.\\nMost EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, US and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.\\nThe Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.\\nIn 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.\\nIn a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis. This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI – though it is now lost. The first available paper generally recognized as \"AI\" was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\" in 1943 – the first mathematical model of a neural network. The paper was influenced by Turing\\'s earlier paper \\'On Computable Numbers\\' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean \\'neurons\\', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.The term \\'Machine Intelligence\\' was used by Alan Turing during his life which was later often referred to as \\'Artificial Intelligence\\' after his death in 1954. In 1950 Turing published the best known of his papers \\'Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\', the paper introduced his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public. Then followed three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing, the lectures: \\'Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’, ‘Can Digital Computers Think’? and the panel discussion ‘Can Automatic Calculating Machines be Said to Think’. By 1956 computer intelligence had been actively pursued for more than a decade in Britain; the earliest AI programmes were written there in 1951–1952.In 1951, using a Ferranti Mark 1 computer of the University of Manchester, checkers and chess programs were wrote where you could play against the computer. The field of American AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US Universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky\\'s and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.Many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).\\nBy 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".Several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.\\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.\\nDeep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing)\\nand access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet).\\nDeep learning\\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.\\nThe amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019,\\nand WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents.\\nAccording to \\'AI Impacts\\', about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the US alone and about 20% of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\";\\nabout 800,000 \"AI\"-related US job openings existed in 2022. The large majority of the advances have occurred within the United States, with its companies, universities, and research labs leading artificial intelligence research.In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.\\n\\n\\n== Philosophy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Defining artificial intelligence ===\\n\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\" He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\". However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\" Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google, a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n\\n\\n=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\n\\n==== Symbolic AI and its limits ====\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\n\\n==== Neat vs. scruffy ====\\n\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\n\\n==== Soft vs. hard computing ====\\n\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\n\\n==== Narrow vs. general AI ====\\n\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals. General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\n\\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\\n\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\n\\n==== Consciousness ====\\n\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.\\n\\n\\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\\n\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.\\n\\n\\n==== Robot rights ====\\n\\nIf a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also suffer; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights. Any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. This issue has been considered in fiction for centuries, and is now being considered by, for example, California\\'s Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.\\n\\n\\n== Future ==\\n\\n\\n=== Superintelligence and the singularity ===\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.\\n\\n\\n=== Transhumanism ===\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.\\n\\n\\n== In fiction ==\\n\\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"Multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAI effect\\nArtificial intelligence detection software – Software to detect AI-generated contentPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\nArtificial intelligence in healthcare – Overview of the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare\\nBehavior selection algorithm – Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation – Technology-enabled automation of complex business processes\\nCase-based reasoning – Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\\nEmergent algorithm – Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence – List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence\\nRobotic process automation – Form of business process automation technology\\nWeak artificial intelligence – Form of artificial intelligence\\nWetware computer – Computer composed of organic material\\nIntelligence amplification – Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\\n\\n\\n== Explanatory notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== AI textbooks ===\\nThe two most widely used textbooks in 2023.

       " 'Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.\\nThe theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.\\nThe fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner. Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine. He started developing this machine in 1834, and \"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\". \"A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom\" making it infinitely programmable. In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer. Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1914, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published his Essays on Automatics, and designed, inspired by Babbage, a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a read-only program. The paper also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic. In 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, Torres presented in Paris the Electromechanical Arithmometer, a prototype that demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine, on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically. In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage\\'s impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage\\'s Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as \"Babbage\\'s dream come true\".\\nDuring the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the Atanasoff–Berry computer and ENIAC, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors. As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general. In 1945, IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City. The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan\\'s West Side was IBM\\'s first laboratory devoted to pure science. The lab is the forerunner of IBM\\'s Research Division, which today operates research facilities around the world. Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and Columbia University was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946. Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s. The world\\'s first computer science degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953. The first computer science department in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962. Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and scope ==\\n\\nAlthough first proposed in 1956, the term \"computer science\" appears in a 1959 article in Communications of the ACM,\\nin which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a Graduate School in Computer Sciences analogous to the creation of Harvard Business School in 1921. Louis justifies the name by arguing that, like management science, the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline.\\nHis efforts, and those of others such as numerical analyst George Forsythe, were rewarded: universities went on to create such departments, starting with Purdue in 1962. Despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves. Because of this, several alternative names have been proposed. Certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science, to emphasize precisely that difference. Danish scientist Peter Naur suggested the term datalogy, to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. The first scientific institution to use the term was the Department of Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, with Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The term is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternative term, also proposed by Naur, is data science; this is now used for a multi-disciplinary field of data analysis, including statistics and databases.\\nIn the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the Communications of the ACM—turingineer, turologist, flow-charts-man, applied meta-mathematician, and applied epistemologist. Three months later in the same journal, comptologist was suggested, followed next year by hypologist. The term computics has also been suggested. In Europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression \"automatic information\" (e.g. \"informazione automatica\" in Italian) or \"information and mathematics\" are often used, e.g. informatique (French), Informatik (German), informatica (Italian, Dutch), informática (Spanish, Portuguese), informatika (Slavic languages and Hungarian) or pliroforiki (πληροφορική, which means informatics) in Greek. Similar words have also been adopted in the UK (as in the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh). \"In the U.S., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain.\"A folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—Edsger Dijkstra, states that \"computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.\" The design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. For example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering, while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems. However, there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physics, biology, Earth science, statistics, philosophy, and logic.\\nComputer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science. Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Rózsa Péter and Alonzo Church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra.The relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term \"software engineering\" means, and how computer science is defined. David Parnas, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.The academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.\\n\\n\\n== Philosophy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Epistemology of computer science ===\\nDespite the word \"science\" in its name, there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science, mathematics, or engineering. Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon argued in 1975, Computer science is an empirical discipline. We would have called it an experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology, some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method. Nonetheless, they are experiments. Each new machine that is built is an experiment. Actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available. It has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the correctness of programs, but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science. Proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in civil engineering and airplanes in aerospace engineering. They also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.Proponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities and programs can be deductively reasoned through mathematical formal methods. Computer scientists Edsger W. Dijkstra and Tony Hoare regard instructions for computer programs as mathematical sentences and interpret formal semantics for programming languages as mathematical axiomatic systems.\\n\\n\\n=== Paradigms of computer science ===\\nA number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. Peter Wegner argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics. Peter Denning\\'s working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design. Amnon H. Eden described them as the \"rationalist paradigm\" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs deductive reasoning), the \"technocratic paradigm\" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the \"scientific paradigm\" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences, identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence).\\nComputer science focuses on methods involved in design, specification, programming, verification, implementation and testing of human-made computing systems.\\n\\n\\n== Fields ==\\n\\nAs a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.CSAB, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation Board—which is made up of representatives of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS)—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: theory of computation, algorithms and data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer elements and architecture. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science.\\n\\n\\n=== Theoretical computer science ===\\n\\nTheoretical Computer Science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from the practical and everyday computation. Its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies.\\n\\n\\n==== Theory of computation ====\\n\\nAccording to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, \"What can be automated?\" Theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. In an effort to answer the first question, computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation. The second question is addressed by computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems.\\nThe famous P = NP? problem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems, is an open problem in the theory of computation.\\n\\n\\n==== Information and coding theory ====\\n\\nInformation theory, closely related to probability and statistics, is related to the quantification of information. This was developed by Claude Shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data.\\nCoding theory is the study of the properties of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more recently also for network coding. Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods.\\n\\n\\n==== Data structures and algorithms ====\\nData structures and algorithms are the studies of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.\\n\\n\\n==== Programming language theory and formal methods ====\\n\\nProgramming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individual features. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. It is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals.\\nFormal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.\\n\\n\\n=== Applied computer science ===\\n\\n\\n==== Computer graphics and visualization ====\\n\\nComputer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including computer vision, image processing, and computational geometry, and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games.\\n\\n\\n==== Image and sound processing ====\\n\\nInformation can take the form of images, sound, video or other multimedia. Bits of information can be streamed via signals. Its processing is the central notion of informatics, the European view on computing, which studies information processing algorithms independently of the type of information carrier – whether it is electrical, mechanical or biological. This field plays important role in information theory, telecommunications, information engineering and has applications in medical image computing and speech synthesis, among others. What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms? is one of unsolved problems in theoretical computer science.\\n\\n\\n==== Computational science, finance and engineering ====\\n\\nScientific computing (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems. A major usage of scientific computing is simulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. The latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits.\\n\\n\\n==== Social computing and human–computer interaction ====\\n\\nSocial computing is an area that is concerned with the intersection of social behavior and computational systems. Human–computer interaction research develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers.\\n\\n\\n==== Software engineering ====\\n\\nSoftware engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying the software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it does not just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance. For example software testing, systems engineering, technical debt and software development processes.\\n\\n\\n==== Artificial intelligence ====\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. From its origins in cybernetics and in the Dartmouth Conference (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence. AI is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was Alan Turing\\'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the Turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\\n\\n\\n=== Computer systems ===\\n\\n\\n==== Computer architecture and organization ====\\n\\nComputer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory. Computer engineers study computational logic and design of computer hardware, from individual processor components, microcontrollers, personal computers to supercomputers and embedded systems. The term \"architecture\" in computer literature can be traced to the work of Lyle R. Johnson and Frederick P. Brooks Jr., members of the Machine Organization department in IBM\\'s main research center in 1959.\\n\\n\\n==== Concurrent, parallel and distributed computing ====\\n\\nConcurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. A number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including Petri nets, process calculi and the Parallel Random Access Machine model. When multiple computers are connected in a network while using concurrency, this is known as a distributed system. Computers within that distributed system have their own private memory, and information can be exchanged to achieve common goals.\\n\\n\\n==== Computer networks ====\\n\\nThis branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide.\\n\\n\\n==== Computer security and cryptography ====\\n\\nComputer security is a branch of computer technology with the objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users.\\nHistorical cryptography is the art of writing and deciphering secret messages. Modern cryptography is the scientific study of problems relating to distributed computations that can be attacked. Technologies studied in modern cryptography include symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, key-agreement protocols, blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and garbled circuits.\\n\\n\\n==== Databases and data mining ====\\n\\nA database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through database models and query languages. Data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets.\\n\\n\\n== Discoveries ==\\nThe philosopher of computing Bill Rapaport noted three Great Insights of Computer Science:\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\'s, George Boole\\'s, Alan Turing\\'s, Claude Shannon\\'s, and Samuel Morse\\'s insight: there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent \"anything\".All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as \"on/off\", \"magnetized/de-magnetized\", \"high-voltage/low-voltage\", etc.).\\nAlan Turing\\'s insight: there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do \"anything\".Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:move left one location;\\nmove right one location;\\nread symbol at current location;\\nprint 0 at current location;\\nprint 1 at current location.\\nCorrado Böhm and Giuseppe Jacopini\\'s insight: there are only three ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do \"anything\".Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:\\nsequence: first do this, then do that;\\n selection: IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;\\nrepetition: WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.\\nThe three rules of Boehm\\'s and Jacopini\\'s insight can be further simplified with the use of goto (which means it is more elementary than structured programming).\\n\\n\\n== Programming paradigms ==\\n\\nProgramming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:\\n\\nFunctional programming, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.\\nImperative programming, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program\\'s state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\\nObject-oriented programming, a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object\\'s procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.\\nService-oriented programming, a programming paradigm that uses \"services\" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated business applications and mission critical software programsMany languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.\\n\\n\\n== Research ==\\n\\nConferences are important events for computer science research. During these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. Unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications. One proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\nComputer Science, known by its near synonyms, Computing, Computer Studies, has been taught in UK schools since the days of batch processing, mark sensitive cards and paper tape but usually to a select few students. In 1981, the BBC produced a micro-computer and classroom network and Computer Studies became common for GCE O level students (11–16-year-old), and Computer Science to A level students. Its importance was recognised, and it became a compulsory part of the National Curriculum, for Key Stage 3 & 4. In September 2014 it became an entitlement for all pupils over the age of 4.In the US, with 14,000 school districts deciding the curriculum, provision was fractured. According to a 2010 report by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science. According to a 2021 report, only 51% of high schools in the US offer computer science.Israel, New Zealand, and South Korea have included computer science in their national secondary education curricula, and several others are following.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nDBLP Computer Science Bibliography\\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers',\n",
       " 'The European Central Bank (ECB) is the prime component of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) as well as one of seven institutions of the European Union. It is one of the world\\'s most important central banks.\\nThe ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy for the Eurozone and the European Union, administers the foreign exchange reserves of EU member states, engages in foreign exchange operations, and defines the intermediate monetary objectives and key interest rate of the EU. The ECB Executive Board enforces the policies and decisions of the Governing Council, and may direct the national central banks when doing so. The ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ECB beforehand. The bank also operates the TARGET2 payments system.\\nThe ECB was established by the Treaty of Amsterdam in May 1999 with the purpose of guaranteeing and maintaining price stability. On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon became effective and the bank gained the official status of an EU institution. When the ECB was created, it covered a Eurozone of eleven members. Since then, Greece joined in January 2001, Slovenia in January 2007, Cyprus and Malta in January 2008, Slovakia in January 2009, Estonia in January 2011, Latvia in January 2014, Lithuania in January 2015 and Croatia in January 2023. The current President of the ECB is Christine Lagarde. Seated in Frankfurt, Germany, the bank formerly occupied the Eurotower prior to the construction of its new seat.\\nThe ECB is directly governed by European Union law. Its capital stock, worth €11 billion, is owned by all 27 central banks of the EU member states as shareholders. The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states\\' population and GDP, but the capital key has been readjusted since. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years of the ECB (1998–2007) ===\\nThe European Central Bank is the de facto successor of the European Monetary Institute (EMI). The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EU\\'s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and European System of Central Banks (ESCB).  The EMI itself took over from the earlier European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF).The ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the Treaty on European Union (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU. The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of Pierre Werner and President Jacques Delors. It was established on 1 June 1998 The first President of the Bank was Wim Duisenberg, the former president of the Dutch central bank and the European Monetary Institute. While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI (taking over from Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium) just before the ECB came into existence, the French government wanted Jean-Claude Trichet, former head of the French central bank, to be the ECB\\'s first president. The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany, its president should be French. This was opposed by the German, Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro. Tensions were abated by a gentleman\\'s agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by Trichet.Trichet replaced Duisenberg as president in November 2003. Until 2007, the ECB had very successfully managed to maintain inflation close but below 2%.\\n\\n\\n=== The ECB\\'s response to the financial crises (2008–2014) ===\\nThe European Central Bank underwent through a deep internal transformation as it faced the global financial crisis and the Eurozone debt crisis. \\n\\n\\n==== Early response to the Eurozone debt crisis ====\\nThe so-called European debt crisis began after Greece\\'s new elected government uncovered the real level indebtedness and budget deficit and warned EU institutions of the imminent danger of a Greek sovereign default.\\nForeseeing a possible sovereign default in the eurozone, the general public, international and European institutions, and the financial community reassessed the economic situation and creditworthiness of some Eurozone member states. Consequently, sovereign bonds yields of several Eurozone countries started to rise sharply. This provoked a self-fulfilling panic on financial markets: the more Greek bonds yields rose, the more likely a default became possible, the more bond yields increased in turn.This panic was also aggravated because of the reluctance of the ECB to react and intervene on sovereign bond markets for two reasons. First, because the ECB\\'s legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds in the primary market (Article 123. TFEU), An over-interpretation of this limitation, inhibited the ECB from implementing quantitative easing like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets.\\nSecondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB\\'s open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB Athanasios Orphanides, this change in the ECB\\'s collateral framework \"planted the seed\" of the euro crisis.Faced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets. Up until 6 May 2010, Trichet formally denied at several press conferences the possibility of the ECB to embark into sovereign bonds purchases, even though Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy faced waves of credit rating downgrades and increasing interest rate spreads.\\n\\n\\n==== ECB\\'s market interventions (2010–2011) ====\\nIn a remarkable u-turn, the ECB announced on 10 May 2010, the launch of a \"Securities Market Programme\" (SMP) which involved the discretionary purchase of sovereign bonds in secondary markets. Extraordinarily, the decision was taken by the Governing Council during a teleconference call only three days after the ECB\\'s usual meeting of 6 May (when Trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds). The ECB justified this decision by the necessity to \"address severe tensions in financial markets.\" The decision also coincided with the EU leaders decision of 10 May to establish the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism, which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis.Although at first limited to the debt of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the bulk of the ECB\\'s bond buying eventually consisted of Spanish and Italian debt. These purchases were intended to dampen international speculation against stressed countries, and thus avoid a contagion of the Greek crisis towards other Eurozone countries. The assumption—largely justified—was that speculative activity would decrease over time and the value of the assets increase.\\nAlthough SMP purchases did inject liquidity into financial markets, all of these injections were \"sterilized\" through weekly liquidity absorption. So the operation was net neutral in liquidity terms (though this was of little practical importance since normal monetary policy operations were ensuring unlimited supplies of liquidity at the main policy interest rate).In September 2011, ECB\\'s Board member Jürgen Stark, resigned in protest against the \"Securities Market Programme\" which involved the purchase of sovereign bonds from Southern member states, a move that he considered as equivalent to monetary financing, which is prohibited by the EU Treaty. The Financial Times Deutschland referred to this episode as \"the end of the ECB as we know it\", referring to its hitherto perceived \"hawkish\" stance on inflation and its historical Deutsche Bundesbank influence.As of 18 June 2012, the ECB in total had spent €212.1bn (equal to 2.2% of the Eurozone GDP) for bond purchases covering outright debt, as part of the Securities Markets Programme. Controversially, the ECB made substantial profits out of SMP, which were largely redistributed to Eurozone countries. In 2013, the Eurogroup decided to refund those profits to Greece, however, the payments were suspended from 2014 until 2017 over the conflict between Yanis Varoufakis and ministers of the Eurogroup. In 2018, profits refunds were reinstalled by the Eurogroup. However, several NGOs complained that a substantial part of the ECB profits would never be refunded to Greece.\\n\\n\\n==== Role in the Troika (2010–2015) ====\\n\\nThe ECB played a controversial role in the \"Troika\" by rejecting most forms of debt restructuring of public and bank debts, and pressing governments to adopt bailout programmes and structural reforms through secret letters to Italian, Spanish, Greek and Irish governments. It has further been accused of interfering in the Greek referendum of July 2015 by constraining liquidity to Greek commercial banks.\\nIn November 2010, reflecting the huge increase in borrowing, including the cover the cost of having guaranteed the liabilities of banks, the cost of borrowing in the private financial markets had become prohibitive for the Irish government. Although it had deferred the cash cost of recapitalising the failing Anglo Irish Bank by nationalising it and issuing it with a \"promissory note\" (an IOU), the Government also faced a large deficit on its non-banking activities, and it therefore turned to the official sector for a loan to bridge the shortfall until its finances were credibly back on a sustainable footing. (Meanwhile, Anglo used the promissory note as collateral for its emergency loan (ELA) from the Central Bank. This enabled Anglo was able to repay its depositors and bondholders.\\nIt became clear later that the ECB played a key role in making sure the Irish government did not let Anglo default on its debts, to avoid financial instability risks. On 15 October and 6 November 2010, the ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sent two secret letters to the Irish finance Minister which essentially informed the Irish government of the possible suspension of ELA\\'s credit lines, unless the government requested a financial assistance programme to the Eurogroup under the condition of further reforms and fiscal consolidation.\\nIn addition, the ECB insisted that no debt restructuring (or bail-in) should be applied to the nationalized banks\\' bondholders, a measure which could have saved Ireland 8 billion euros.During 2012, the ECB pressed for an early end to the ELA, and this situation was resolved with the liquidation of the successor institution IBRC in February 2013. The promissory note was exchanged for much longer term marketable floating rate notes which were disposed of by the Central Bank over the following decade.\\nIn April 2011, the ECB raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 from 1% to 1.25%, with a further increase to 1.50% in July 2011. However, in 2012–2013 the ECB sharply lowered interest rates to encourage economic growth, reaching the historically low 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were cut to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 the central bank reduced the rates by two-thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%. Recently, the interest rates were further reduced reaching 0.00%, the lowest rates on record.In a report adopted on 13 March 2014, the European Parliament criticized the \"potential conflict of interest between the current role of the ECB in the Troika as \\'technical advisor\\' and its position as a creditor of the four Member States, as well as its mandate under the Treaty\". The report was led by Austrian right-wing MEP Othmar Karas and French Socialist MEP Liem Hoang Ngoc.\\n\\n\\n==== The ECB\\'s response under Mario Draghi (2012–2015) ====\\nOn 1 November 2011, Mario Draghi replaced Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the ECB. This change in leadership also marks the start of a new era under which the ECB will become more and more interventionist and eventually ended the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis.\\nDraghi\\'s presidency started with the impressive launch of a new round of 1% interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) – the Long-term Refinancing operations (LTRO). Under this programme, 523 Banks tapped as much as €489.2 bn (US$640 bn). Observers were surprised by the volume of loans made when it was implemented. By far biggest amount of €325bn was tapped by banks in Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain. Although those LTROs loans did not directly benefit EU governments, it effectively allowed banks to do a carry trade, by lending off the LTROs loans to governments with an interest margin. The operation also facilitated the rollover of €200bn of maturing bank debts in the first three months of 2012.\\n\\n\\n===== \"Whatever it takes\" (26 July 2012) =====\\nFacing renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone continued Mario Draghi made a decisive speech in London, by declaring that the ECB \"...is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\" In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi\\'s statement has been seen as a key turning point in the eurozone crisis, as it was immediately welcomed by European leaders, and led to a steady decline in bond yields for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France.Following up on Draghi\\'s speech, on 6 September 2012 the ECB announced the Outright Monetary Transactions programme (OMT). Unlike the previous SMP programme, OMT has no ex-ante time or size limit. However, the activation of the purchases remains conditioned to the adherence by the benefitting country to an adjustment programme to the ESM. The program was adopted with near unanimity, the Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann being the sole member of the ECB\\'s Governing Council to vote against it.Even if OMT was never actually implemented until today, it made the \"Whatever it takes\" pledge credible and significantly contributed to stabilizing financial markets and ending the sovereign debt crisis. According to various sources, the OMT programme and \"whatever it takes\" speeches were made possible because EU leaders previously agreed to build the banking union.\\n\\n\\n=== Low inflation and quantitative easing (2015–2019) ===\\nIn November 2014, the bank moved into its new premises, while the Eurotower building was dedicated to hosting the newly established supervisory activities of the ECB under European Banking Supervision.Although the sovereign debt crisis was almost solved by 2014, the ECB started to face a repeated decline in the Eurozone inflation rate, indicating that the economy was going towards a deflation. Responding to this threat, the ECB announced on 4 September 2014 the launch of two bond buying purchases programmes: the Covered Bond Purchasing Programme (CBPP3) and Asset-Backed Securities Programme (ABSPP).On 22 January 2015, the ECB announced an extension of those programmes within a full-fledge \"quantitative easing\" programme which also included sovereign bonds, to the tune of 60 billion euros per month up until at least September 2016. The programme was started on 9 March 2015.On 8 June 2016, the ECB added corporate bonds to its asset purchases portfolio with the launch of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). Under this programme, it conducted the net purchase of corporate bonds until January 2019 to reach about €177 billion. While the programme was halted for 11 months in January  2019, the ECB restarted net purchases in November 2019.As of 2021, the size of the ECB\\'s quantitative easing programme had reached 2947 billion euros.\\n\\n\\n==== Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) ====\\nThe long term refinancing operations (LTRO) are regular open market operations providing financing to credit institutions for periods up to four years. They aim at favoring lending conditions to the private sector and more generally stimulating bank lending to the real economy, thereby fostering growth.\\nIn December 2011 and January 2012, in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, the ECB implemented two LTROs, injecting over €1000 billions of liquidity in the Eurozone financial system. They were later criticized for their inability to revive growth and to help truly revive the real economy, despite having stabilized the Eurozone’s financial institutions. Further, these operations were devoid of monitoring from the ECB regarding the use made of these liquidities and it appeared that banks had significantly used these funds to pursue carry-trade strategies, purchasing sovereign bonds with higher rates and corresponding maturity to generate profits, instead of increasing private lending.These critics and deficiencies brought the ECB to instigate targeted long term refinancing operations (TLTROs), first in September and later in December 2014. These complementary programs imposed conditionality on the LTROs. The TLTROs provided low cost financing to participating banks, under the condition that they reached certain targets in terms of lending to firms and households. The participating banks were thus more incited to lend to the real economy. A third wave of TLTRO’s was announced on 7 March 2019, namely the TLTRO III.\\n\\n\\n=== Christine Lagarde\\'s era (2019– ) ===\\nIn July 2019, EU leaders nominated Christine Lagarde to replace Mario Draghi as ECB President. Lagarde resigned from her position as managing director of the International Monetary Fund in July 2019 and formally took over the ECB\\'s presidency on 1 November 2019.Lagarde immediately signalled a change of style in the ECB\\'s leadership. She embarked the ECB on a strategic review of the ECB\\'s monetary policy strategy, an exercise the ECB had not done for 17 years. As part of this exercise, Lagarde committed the ECB to look into how monetary policy could contribute to address climate change, and promised that \"no stone would be left unturned.\" The ECB president also adopted a change of communication style, in particular in her use of social media to promote gender equality, and by opening dialogue with civil society stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n=== COVID-19 ===\\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an unprecedented crisis, profoundly impacting global public health, economies, and societal structures on an unparalleled scale. The COVID-19 crisis stands in contrast to the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis as it represents an exogenous shock to the real economy, stemming from measures implemented to mitigate the public health emergency, distinct from the internal financial origins of the preceding crisis that transposed repercussions onto the real economy. Following the measures implemented by all governments to counter the spread of COVID-19 across Europe, investors fled to safety, which caused the risk of fire sales in asset markets, illiquidity spirals, credit spikes and discontinuities associated with market freezes. The flight-to-safety also encouraged the fear that after the COVID-19 crisis was over, the stronger economies would emerge even stronger, while the weak economies would get even weaker. Thanks to the more stringent banking regulations implemented after the Global Financial Crisis, a financial crisis was avoided as banks could cope better with the crisis and complementary measures were taken by the EU and national governments.\\n\\n\\n==== Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) ====\\nThe Pandemic Asset Purchase Programme (PEPP) is an asset purchase programme initiated by the ECB to counter the detrimental effects to the Euro Area economy caused by the COVID-19 crisis.\\nTo counter the COVID-19 crisis the ECB has established the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), in which the ECB is able to purchase securities from the private and public sector in a flexible manner, with the purpose to prevent sovereign debt spreads to reach the same levels as during the European debt crisis. It is a quantitative easing unconventional monetary policy, based on the principles of the Asset Purchases Program (APP) which is a similar programme established by the ECB in mid-2014. Asset purchase programmes are intended to bring down risk premia or term premia. However, the PEPP is not entirely the same as the APP, as it can deviate from the capital key strategy followed by the APP. Second, the PEPP-envelope does not need to be used in full. The PEPP is established as a separate purchase programme from and in addition to the APP with the sole purpose to respond to the economic and financial consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. Following Philip R. Lane, chief economist of the ECB, the PEPP plays a dual role in the COVID-19 crisis: (i) ensuring price stability and at the same time (ii) stabilizing the market using the flexibility of the programme to prevent market fragmentation. National central banks are the main purchasers of the bonds under the principle of risk sharing: private bonds fall completely under the risk of national central banks, while only 20% of public bonds are subject to risk sharing. These purchases under the PEPP eventually follow the capital key used in the APP.The flexibility to deviate from the capital key is key for the PEPP: because of the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 it was needed to prevent tightening financial conditions. They prevent yield spreads between the bonds of different member states, caused by the flight-to-safety of investors. The flexibility in asset purchases allows for fluctuations in the distribution of purchases across asset classes and among jurisdictions to prevent market fragmentation. Following this strategy, the PEPP distributed the money among countries in need. The APP follows the capital key strategy, from which no deviations are possible. This makes the APP not able to counter the crisis effectively. Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition argued \"We will need to distribute in order to recover together. These increasing asymmetries will otherwise fragment the single market to a level otherwise none of us is willing to accept,[...].\", as economists feared that the strong economies would come out of the crisis stronger while weak economies would deteriorate because of the crisis. The PEPP is thus a tool used by the ECB to purchase both private and public securities according to the specific needs of EU-countries caused by the COVID-19-crisis. The temporal flexibility from the capital key meant that the ECB could especially prevent the rise of Italian and Spanish yield spreads.\\n\\n\\n===== Assets eligible under the PEPP =====\\nAssets meeting the eligibility criteria of the APP were also eligible under the PEPP. However, the PEPP complemented the APP eligibility framework given the specificity of the PEPP-context of crisis requiring a more tailored response. Among the distinctions is that for the first time since the Greek government-debt crisis, Greek debt is given a waiver under the PEPP so that it could be purchased by the ECB under this programme. This waiver was given based on several considerations from the ECB: there was a need to alleviate the pressures stemming from the pandemic on the Greek financial markets; Greece was already and would be closely monitored by giving the waiver; and Greece regained market access. This proved to be controversial, as Greece is the eurozone\\'s riskiest issuer. Non-financial commercial paper with a remaining maturity of at least 28 days was also eligible for purchase under the PEPP. The maturity criteria for public sector ranges form 70 days up to 30 years and 364 days. As the PEPP can deviate from the capital key strategy, there is also no hard limit on the 33% of a single security per issuer or 33% of a member state\\'s total outstanding security.\\n\\n\\n===== Timeline of the PEPP and TLTRO announcements and purchases =====\\nOn 12 March 2020, Christine Lagarde announced in a press conference a set of policy measures to support the European economy in the rising wake of the pandemic, saying that \"all the flexibilities that are embedded in the framework of the asset purchase programme [...]\" but at the same time she stated that the ECB \"[...] is not here to close spreads.\" This left markets disappointed and let to a particular widening yield spreads in Spain, Italy and Greece. However, the Governing Council announced firstly to provide immediate liquidity through conducting additional LTROs; secondly, to provide more favorable terms on the TLTRO III operations outstanding in the period between June 2020 and June 2021; and thirdly, to announce an additional package of net asset purchases of €120 billion by the end of 2020 under the already existing APP.A day later, on 13 March 2020, the WHO declared Europe the centre of the pandemic.By March 17, a week after the press conference given by Ms. Lagarde, stock index plateaued while the interest rate spread kept on rising over 2.8%.On 18 of March 2020, 6 days after the previous press conference, the ECB announced the launch of the PEPP worth €750 billion to boost liquidity in the European economy and to contain any sharp increases in sovereign yield spreads. This announcement led to an immediate reboot in stock prices and came one day after the spike of sovereign risk spreads. The PEPP became effective as from 24 March 2020, six days after the announcement of the PEPP. By announcing the PEPP the ECB deviated from its pattern of prodding fiscal authorities into action before announcing any monetary stimulus. Together with the additional €120 billion announced on March 12, the PEPP amounted up to 7.3% of the euro-area GDP.On 30 April 2020, the ECB Governing council introduced the Pandemic Emergency Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (PELTROs), with an interest rate of 25bp below the average rate applied in LTROs and for the first time negative.On 4 June 2020, the ECB announced it would expand the PEPP by another €600 billion, as it became clear that the pandemic would continue to harm European economies increasing the total emergency package up to €1.350 trillion. Following Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, dents this ECB decision \"[...] any further speculation about whether or not the ECB is willing to play its role of lender of last resort for the eurozone.\" The expansion showed that the ECB is committed to achieve the price stability objective. However the ECB reiterated that additional fiscal measures should be taken, as the PEPP cannot deliver economic recovery on its own.Half a year later, on 10 December 2020, the ECB announced its final expansion of the PEPP worth another €500 billion, totalling the final PEPP to €1.850 trillion, corresponding to 15.4% of the euro-area GDP of 2019. At the same press conference, the ECB announced that it expected to extend the horizon for net purchases of the PEPP until at least the end of March 2022.\\nIn December 2021 the ECB announced that it would discontinue net purchases under the PEPP as from the end of March 2022 and that it intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities at least until the end of 2024.On 31 March 2022, at the end of the net purchases, the net purchases amounted to €1.718 billion euros, of which €1.665 billion is invested in public sector securities and €52 billion in private sector securities. Of the total €1.850 billion available under the PEPP, 93% of the full envelope wase used, due to indications of decreased financial stress in the Euro Area, mainly thanks to relaxation of COVID restrictions and the reopening of European markets.\\n\\n\\n===== Supports and critiques =====\\nOn 13 March, after Ms. Lagarde stated that the ECB is \"not here to close spreads\", Italian sovereign yield spreads spiked. Italian prime minister Conte stated it would not accept formal and abstract interpretations of the situation. \"[...] the job of the central bank should be not to hinder but to help such [containment] measures by creating favorable financial conditions for them [member states].\" Lagarde then replied by stating that the ECB was \"fully committed to avoid any fragmentation [...].\" In the following week, the PEPP was welcomed by both the prime minister of Italy and Spain as well as by the president of France. They all mostly praise the action of the ECB, and put this as a question of European solidarity. Chief economist at Berenberg also welcomed the measures undertaken by the ECB, stating that \"the authorities would not allow the pandemic shock to the real economy to trigger a financial crisis which, in turn, would exacerbate the economic damage.\" The governor of the Banque de France warned the ECB that it probably needed \"[...] to go even further.\"Following Italian lawmaker for the European Parliament Carlo Calenda there is widespread strong anti-German and anti-Dutch sentiment in the South of Europe, as it seems they \"[...] are taking advantage of being strong in a Europe lacking solidarity.\" These comments are backed by Dutch MEP Paul Tang: \"If we fail to take action at European level, we risk disintegrating the single market and intensifying the antagonism between North and South.\"At the same time, the ECB risks being accused of financing governments if it let the PEPP last for multiple years.\\n\\n\\n==== PEPP challenged before the German Federal Constitutional Court ====\\nOn May 5, 2020, the Court ordered the Bundestag and the Bundesregierung to ensure the ECB had carried out a proportionality assessment of the vast purchases of government debt in the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP) to ensure the economic and fiscal policy effects do not outweigh its policy objectives. The PSPP-implementing decision has been considered an act ultra vires by the ECB as it was too arbitrary and lacks reasoning in ints proportionality assessment. This ruling by the German Constitutional Court comes at a difficult time for the ECB as it was at the time considering expanding the PEPP. The ruling also reflects the mistrust within some parts of Germany in the ECB, which is seen there s an institution that bails out profligate Southern European countries. Moreover this ruling also highlights the vital problem on the euro area architecture, as the range of instruments can use to fulfil its mandate remains unclear. The ruling on the legality of the PSPP could have severe implications on the legality of the PEPP, as it the PEPP has characteristics in common with the PSPP. In March 2021, the PEPP was challenged before the German Federal Constitutional Court.COVID-19, TLTRO III and PELTROs\\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and spread to the old continent, the ECB’s monetary policy response had to guarantee favorable borrowing conditions to firms and households of the euro area. For a significant portion of companies, especially the small and medium-sized, survival was basically at stake. Oftentimes, loans are indeed their only source of finance. In this context of uncertainty, a substantial segment of the ECB response was to adapt the existing TLTRO III, by providing banks with funding at favorable conditions, to further enhance access to credit for undertakings and households.In this endeavor, the ECB had to ensure a high degree of participation from the banks. Hence, on 30 April 2020 the Governing Council of the ECB adopted a package of temporary measures that made several adjustments to the framework of its TLTRO III. An important feature of this response was that the ECB made temporary alterations to its collateral framework by widening the set of assets that could be mobilized as collateral in the liquidity-providing operations and by easing the requirements in this regard. Furthermore, a key change was that the ECB also reduced the interest rate applied to these open market operations to a rate going as low as -1% for the banks meeting the lending threshold of 0%. With the TLTRO III, the participating banks were thus enabled to borrow at lower interest rates than those paid on their excess reserve, that is to say, the liquidities held in their accounts in their respective central banks. This scheme was scheduled until June 2022. Furthermore, the banks’ repayment options were loosened, along with the participation modalities. Regarding the latter, the ECB anticipated future potential falls in the ratings of some assets, and therefore established that if the requirements of collateral eligibility had been met prior to April 7, 2020, these assets would remain eligible in the collateral framework, as long as their rating remained above or at a given threshold (credit quality step 5). The ECB also expanded bank’s borrowing allowance under TLTRO III from 30% to 50%, then up to 55% of their portfolio of loans to firms and households.Another important facet of the ECB policy response was the launching of pandemic emergency long-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). These are complements to the multiple recalibrations of the TLTRO III. On 30 April 2020, the ECB Governing Council announced these additional long-term loans programs. They are similar to the TLTRO III in their aim of ensuring liquidity in the market and smoothening borrowing conditions in these times of pandemic. For this purpose, the PELTRO’s also provide collateral easing measures and negative interest rates. On December 10, 2020, the ECB issued four additional PELTRO’s, taking place on a quarterly basis during 2021.During the pandemic, these monetary responses proved essential to counter the loss of revenue suffered by firms and the spurt of demand for loans that naturally ensued. In their absence, a credit crunch would normally have taken place. Indeed, increase in demand traditionally translates in a rise of borrowing costs. However, ECB easing measures allowed banks to lend massively without an increase of the rates. Empirical evidence is paramount in order to properly assess if the effects on the real economy of those cheaper fundings offered to banks have indeed matched the intention of the European Central Bank (stimulate the granting of loans to undertakings and households). Reports from various member states central banks on the matter indicate that loans supply by participating banks has indeed expanded, in line with the ECB policy. Accordingly, thorough academic studies have confirmed the actual enhancement of financing conditions and the avoidance of credit scarcity. In fact, the credit to firms attained unprecedented levels when from March to May 2020, it increased by €250 billion on aggregate.In addition, the massive involvement of banks in the TLTROs and PELTROs had an important positive side effect. There was a reduction in the issuance of bonds by banks, that usually showed a preference for central bank liquidity for their financing. This, in turn, prevented the cost of issuance of such bonds from surging, which suggests that even non-participating banks (to the TLTROs and PELTROs) benefited from it in parallel manners. The downward pressure on bonds yields also implies that banks having a bigger fraction of the assets side of their balance sheet composed of outstanding bonds were those that benefited the most from the TLTROs and their decrease of funding cost.Furthermore, the question of “zombie firms” has been raised. These refer to unprofitable businesses that only survive by perpetuating their indebtedness. The pandemic, along with the accommodating funding costs (notably brought through the readjustment of the TLTRO III), could have led to an increased number of those under-competitive firms allowed to survive by successive credits. Yet, scientific studies have shown that this increase was very limited from 2019 to 2020.\\n\\n\\n==== Transmission Protection instrument (TPI) ====\\nThe Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) is a tool the ECB could use to ensure monetary policy decisions are smoothly transmitted across all euro area countries, introduced on July 21, 2022. Under the TPI, the ECB would be able to purchase securities in the secondary market, to counter against \"unwanted, disorderly market dynamics\", self fulfilling crises market expectations that do not reflect reality, thus not justified by \"country specific fundamentals.\" The TPI thus enables the ECB to control the difference between borrowing costs across the euro area, thereby reducing fragmentation risk across the euro area. By not letting interfere market dynamics that do not reflect economic reality, the ECB fulfils its secondary mandate under the TFEU, namely \"to support the general economic policies of the Union.\" Although PEPP would remain the first line of defence to counter for transmission risks, the TPI should be seen as an addition to the ECB\\'s toolkit.\\n\\n\\n===== Eligible securities under the TPI =====\\nContrary to the PEPP and the APP, the TPI does not have an ex ante upper limit on the purchase of securities. Although the ECB has stated it would primarily buy only government bonds on the secondary market maturing between 1 and 10 years, the bonds purchased fall under the complete discretion of the ECB and does not necessarily follow the capital key, and private securities could be considered as well. However, there are four conditions that need to be met before securities are eligible for purchasing under TPI:\\nCompliance with the fiscal framework of the EU and not be involved in the excessive deficit procedure;\\nAbsence of macroeconomic imbalances and not being involved in an excessive macroeconomic imbalance procedure, demonstrating that it is in compliance with the Commission\\'s recommendations;\\nSovereign debt trajectory must be sustainable, assessed by the ECB and other relevant bodies;\\nStick to commitments made under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, proving that the government follows sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies.The conditions for government bonds to be eligible under the TPI draw heavily on the macroeconomic governance, and making sure that politicians do not take decisions that facilitate speculation. The decision by the ECB to support a country by using the TPI will depend on the severity of the risks a country faces. Government debt should thus be sustainable to be eligible for TPI purchases.If the aforementioned conditions are met, the ECB could decide to activate the TPI. Purchases will be ended under the TPI either due to increased transmission of monetary policy or the risks have proven to be country-specific. So far, the TPI has not been deployed yet.\\n\\n\\n===== Effects of and critiques on the TPI =====\\nThe TPI enables the Governing Council to a more rapid increase in interest rate, the first raise in interest rates by the ECB in 11 years. and the unpredictable nature of market sentiment could justify the reason for ECB-intervention to stabilise the monetary union, more or less the same reasoning as for the PEPP.\\nHowever, the relationship between the PEPP and the TPI raises questions as the PEPP would remain the first line of defence against transmission risks. The creation of the TPI seems legally vulnerably: problems in the Euro Area are common and recurring, but it is not automatically the argument to invent a whole new anti-fragmentation tool. With the TPI, the ECB can put pressure on countries by assessing publicly if they are eligible for the TPI, that is assessing whether the government has conducted adequate fiscal policies and structural reforms to deserve the support of the ECB. This endangers the politic neutrality of the ECB. If ever deployed, the usage of the TPI will spark controversy as the conditions to be deployed are not watertight.\\n\\n\\n===== Strategy Review =====\\nAs a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis, the ECB extended the duration of the strategy review until September 2021. On 13 July 2021, the ECB presented the outcomes of the strategy review, with the main following announcements:\\n\\nThe ECB announced a new inflation target of 2% instead of its \"close but below two per cent\" inflation target. The ECB also made it clear it could overshoot its target under certain circumstances.\\nThe ECB announced it would try to incorporate the cost of housing (imputed rents) into its inflation measurement\\nThe ECB announced an action plan on climate changeThe ECB also said it would carry out another strategy review in 2025.\\n\\n\\n=== Inflation surge of 2021 ===\\nIn the summer of 2021, coinciding with the European Central Bank\\'s announcement of its revised monetary policy framework and its initiative for climate action, the eurozone witnessed a notable inflationary surge. This resurgence of inflation continued to escalate over the following year, culminating in inflation rates reaching double digits for the first time since the 1970s, a year after the ECB\\'s strategic updates. The inflation rate reached an unprecedented peak of 4.9% in November 2021, marking the highest level since the introduction of the euro.\\n\\n\\n==== Framing of the crisis ====\\nThe new era of inflation prompted a significant shift in the European Central Bank\\'s framing compared to its stance in the 2000s. Initially, from its inception until the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the ECB\\'s primary objective was price stability, adhering to strict institutional rules that minimized policy trade-offs with other goals beyond price stability. This approach was rooted in the \"Central Bank Independence template\", advocating that central bank\\'s limited role to price stability and its independence were optimal.However, the post-financial crisis landscape, especially during the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s and subsequent economic stagnation era, necessitated a substantial revision in the ECB\\'s strategy. The ECB moved away from its original Central Bank Independence template, leading to a blurring of its objective hierarchy. It adopted new strategies such as acting as a lender of last resort for the banking system and fostering growth through very low interest rates and extensive asset purchase programs, which were designed to help stabilizing specific market segments and in the end revive growth.In 2021, the European Central Bank embraced a significant strategic pivot by adopting its Climate Action Plan along with a new monetary policy strategy. This shift aimed to institutionalize the ECB\\'s evolving role, moving beyond the singular focus on price stability—a policy shaped largely by the aftermath of the European sovereign debt crisis. Instead, the ECB began acknowledging its multifaceted responsibilities, which now include maintaining financial stability, supporting economic growth, and addressing climate-related objectives. However, with the surging of inflation in 2021, some wondered as to whether the European Central Bank would revert to its foundational role, predominantly focused on chasing the “inflation monsters”. The term “inflation monsters\\'\\' echoes the 2010 video of the ECB where two young people are facing a blue inflation monster unleashing banknotes and threatening to wreck the economy. Nevertheless, ECB policymakers effectively drew connections between the Central Bank Independence (CBI) framework and the experiences of the stagflation era to rationalize their decision to increase interest rates, avoiding the need for a discourse on regime change. In doing so, they recognized the complex trade-offs inherent in balancing various macroeconomic objectives and the challenging decisions they had to face.It was with this new monetary strategy that the eurozone found itself facing rising inflation in 2021. Recent studies stated that key debate among policymakers centered on whether this inflationary trend would be transitory or permanent. Paul Krugman argued that the current inflationary surge would prove to be transitory, whereas other economists such as Olivier Blanchard and Larry Summers had issued warnings regarding the possible persistence of this inflation. Initially, both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve misjudged the situation, assuming the inflation spike to be temporary and expecting a swift return to their inflation target. This misperception led to the ECB\\'s initial inaction regarding its monetary policy.\\n\\n\\n==== Response to the 2021 inflation crisis ====\\nAfter big increases in the inflation rates throughout 2021 and 2022, the European Central Bank and the FED finally decided to raise their interest rates and abandon their very low interest rates, for the first time since the sovereign debt crisis and the end of the CBI era, as it had become clear the inflationary trend wasn’t temporary. This decision came in late July 2022 for the ECB, when the inflation rate in the eurozone was already at 8.9% and had been higher than the 2% target for more than a year, and in March 2022 for the FED. The European Central Bank\\'s response to the Federal Reserve\\'s actions can partly be attributed to concerns about imported inflation from the USA. Specifically, if the FED increases its policy rates while the ECB remains static, it could lead to a depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Such a scenario would likely result in higher import costs for the eurozone, as many global trade goods are priced in dollars. On the other hand, this would benefit the US economy by making imports from the eurozone cheaper.Furthermore, the impact of US dollar appreciation, following the FED\\'s policy rate hikes, tends to be more pronounced in the international inflation rates of energy and food. These commodities are commonly priced in US dollars, making their inflation rates more sensitive to exchange rate variations. In the European Union, public inflation expectations are significantly influenced by the prices of energy and food. Thus, this form of imported inflation can further exacerbate overall inflation levels of the eurozone.\\nThe ECB also declared its intention to systematically diminish net asset purchases within their asset purchase program (APP) and end them under the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) launched during the COVID crisis by the first trimester of 2022. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve initiated the reduction of its asset purchase program in November 2021, to finally stop it by March 2022. The Asset Purchase Programs of the ECB initially boosted asset values on bank balance sheets and led to expectations of lower future short short-term interest rates. These programs also raised inflation expectations, eventually reanchoring long-term inflation expectations. Phasing out the Asset Purchase Programs thus signals alignment with the different policy rate hikes in an attempt to cool down the economy and demonstrates a commitment to combating inflation.Research indicates that the European Central Bank responded to the escalating inflation more slowly and cautiously than the FED, showing hopes that a moderate tightening of monetary policy would suffice. The ECB was notably slower in acknowledging the mistaken nature of its initial assumption that the inflationary trend would be transitory. The transition away from extremely low interest rates was soon accompanied by various rate increases, culminating in the ECB\\'s main rate reaching 4% by the end of September. In contrast, the FED\\'s latest rate hike elevated the Effective Federal Funds Rate to 5.33% in August, underscoring a more aggressive and rapid tightening of monetary policy compared to the ECB\\'s approach. However, the global monetary tightening cycle turned out to be the most synchronized one in the past half-century. By February 2023, more than 90% of economies had hiked their policy rates. The latest peak of highly synchronized action by central banks was during the 1970s and the oil prices shocks where 70% of them had raised their interest rates.\\n\\n\\n==== Critics regarding the new monetary policy ====\\nCriticism first emerged regarding the methodologies used for inflation estimation and their failure to anticipate the inflation surge. A primary critique focused on the inadequacy of traditional tools like the Phillips Curve, which examines the relationship between inflation and certain economic activity indicators, for accurately forecasting inflation. During the 1970s, the Phillips Curve also faced significant criticism for its inability to accurately predict the inflation experienced in that decade. This period marked a critical reassessment of the curve\\'s predictive capacity, particularly in the context of the economic phenomena of the time. Traditional indicators used for forecasting economic dynamics, such as the output and unemployment gaps, were found to be inadequate in signaling the overheating of the economy and the prevailing tight labor market conditions. Moreover, the important belief among central banks that sustained inflationary increases are a consequence of unanchored long-term inflation expectations was challenged during 2021-2022. During this period, inflation expectations remained relatively stable, leading to the misinterpretations by the European Central Bank and other monetary authorities regarding the inflationary trend\\'s nature. Both the FED and the ECB argued that the rise in inflation was only temporary and was the sole result of post-pandemic supply disruptions on a few selected goods and services (food and energy). The FED and the ECB then maintained their expansionary monetary policy, keeping interest rates low.Some critics have also emerged saying that it was complicated for independent central banks, including the ECB, to accurately assess during a synchronized policy rate hike the potential spillovers of cross-countries monetary policy on the inflation. This might lead to excessive monetary tightening (higher interest rates) in unusual circumstances.Concerns have also been raised about the European Central Bank\\'s effectiveness in addressing the recent surge in energy prices. Some experts suggest that the eurozone should be viewed as a small open economy, implying that changes in its demand may not significantly impact global prices. Moreover, they argue that monetary policy might have minimal influence on the global demand for energy. This is because household demand for essentials like heating and transportation is believed to be relatively insensitive to price changes. Additionally, while a stronger euro could theoretically lead to lower import prices, it\\'s uncertain whether these savings would be effectively passed on to consumers.\\nHowever, recent studies contradict these views by highlighting the significant role of energy prices in the transmission of monetary policy within the eurozone. An increase in the ECB\\'s policy rates tends to appreciate the euro against the dollar. This appreciation can lead to higher local energy costs but may also reduce demand, potentially lowering global energy prices. These studies support the ECB\\'s decision to follow the Federal Reserve\\'s lead in raising policy rates, which appears to have been a strategic move to curb imported inflation and address the spike in energy prices.\\n\\n\\n==== Effects of the monetary tightening ====\\nThe implementing a of tighter monetary policy has emerged as the eurozone solution to fight the latest inflationary pressure. However, this approach bears the risk of hindering the progress of the economic revival post-COVID.\\nRaising interest rates is a strategic move by the ECB with specific aims: to decelerate economic activity, stabilize inflation expectations, and steer towards lower inflation levels. Studies have shown that as interest rates rise, the price on the world market does not really change. However, the Euro becomes more attractive to investors, leading to its appreciation against other currencies. This change benefits households paying for gas in Euros, as it translates into lower prices for dollar-traded oil.On the other hand, the increase in interest rates, while helping to suppress prices, also places strains on the manufacturing sector and the labor market. The aftermath of this shock sees tighter financing conditions and a dip in demand, resulting in a slight uptick in unemployment rates, going beyond 0.1 percentage points. Although the study shows that manufacturing sector quickly rebounds, returning to its pre-shock state within about three months, the impact on unemployment rates lingers for a longer period.\\n\\n\\n== Mandate and inflation target ==\\nThe ECB has one primary objective – price stability – subject to which it may pursue secondary objectives.\\n\\n\\n=== Primary mandate ===\\nThe primary objective of the European Central Bank, set out in Article 127(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is to maintain price stability within the Eurozone. However the EU Treaties do not specify exactly how the ECB should pursue this objective. The European Central Bank has ample discretion over the way it pursues its price stability objective, as it can self-decide on the inflation target, and may also influence the way inflation is being measured.\\nSince 2021, the ECB has defined its objective as targeting an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term. Before that, the precise formulation of the price stability objective has changed over the years:\\nThe Governing Council in October 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, \"a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\" and added that price stability \"was to be maintained over the medium term\". In May 2003, following a thorough review of the ECB\\'s monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council clarified that \"in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term\". In 2016, the European Central Bank\\'s president has further adjusted its communication, by introducing the notion of \"symmetry\" in its definition of its target, thus making it clear that the ECB should respond both to inflationary pressures and to deflationary pressures. As Draghi once said \"symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently low inflation, but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2%.\"On 8 July 2021, as a result of the strategic review led by the new president Christine Lagarde, the ECB officially abandoned the \"below but close to two per cent\" definition and adopted instead a 2% symmetric target.\\n\\n\\n=== Secondary mandate ===\\nWithout prejudice to the objective of price stability, the Treaty (127 TFEU) also provides room for the ECB to pursue other objectives:Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union.This legal provision is often considered to provide a \"secondary mandate\" to the ECB and offers ample justifications for the ECB to also prioritize other considerations such as full employment or environmental protection, which are mentioned in the Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union. At the same time, economists and commentators are often divided on whether and how the ECB should pursue those secondary objectives, in particular the environmental impact. ECB official have also frequently pointed out the possible contradictions between those secondary objectives. To better guide the ECB\\'s action on its secondary objectives, it has been suggested that closer consultation with the European Parliament would be warranted. In 2023, the ECB recognised the possible role of the European Parliament in the prioritisation of its secondary objectives.\\n\\n\\n=== Tasks ===\\nTo carry out its main mission, the ECB\\'s tasks include:\\n\\nDefining and implementing monetary policy\\nManaging foreign exchange operations\\nMaintaining the payment system to promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the TARGET2 payments system and being currently developed technical platform for the settlement of securities in Europe (TARGET2 Securities).\\nConsultative role: by law, the ECB\\'s opinion is required on any national or EU legislation that falls within the ECB\\'s competence.\\nCollection and establishment of statistics\\nInternational cooperation\\nIssuing banknotes: the ECB holds the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand (upon the introduction of the euro, the ECB also had exclusive right to issue coins).\\nFinancial stability and prudential policy\\nBanking supervision: since 2013, the ECB has been put in charge of supervising systemically relevant banks.\\n\\n\\n=== Monetary policy tools ===\\nThe principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements. The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt.All lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB.The criteria for determining \"high quality\" for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union: total debt must not be too large in relation to a gross domestic product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large. Though these criteria are fairly simple, a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency—or the lack of the same.\\n\\n\\n=== Difference with US Federal Reserve ===\\nIn the United States Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve buys assets: typically, bonds issued by the Federal government. There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as commercial paper. The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for the functioning of the financial system.The Eurosystem, on the other hand, uses collateralized lending as a default instrument. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term repo contracts. The difference is that banks in effect borrow cash from the ECB and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the number of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank\\'s balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman\\'s terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted.  The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to sovereign debt as a percentage of each member state\\'s gross domestic product, are designed to ensure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation.\\n\\n\\n== Organization ==\\nThe ECB has four decision-making bodies, that take all the decisions with the objective of fulfilling the ECB\\'s mandate:\\n\\nthe Executive Board,\\nthe Governing Council,\\nthe General Council, and\\nthe Supervisory Board.\\n\\n\\n=== Decision-making bodies ===\\n\\n\\n==== Executive Board ====\\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the implementation of monetary policy (defined by the Governing Council) and the day-to-day running of the bank. It can issue decisions to national central banks and may also exercise powers delegated to it by the Governing Council. Executive Board members are assigned a portfolio of responsibilities by the President of the ECB. The executive board normally meets every Tuesday.\\nIt is composed of the President of the Bank (currently Christine Lagarde), the vice-president (currently Luis de Guindos) and four other members. They are all appointed by the European Council for non-renewable terms of eight years. Members of the executive board of the ECB are appointed \"from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council, after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB\".José Manuel González-Páramo, a Spanish member of the executive board since June 2004, was due to leave the board in early June 2012, but no replacement had been named as of late May. The Spanish had nominated Barcelona-born Antonio Sáinz de Vicuña – an ECB veteran who heads its legal department – as González-Páramo\\'s replacement as early as January 2012, but alternatives from Luxembourg, Finland, and Slovenia were put forward and no decision made by May. After a long political battle and delays due to the European Parliament\\'s protest over the lack of gender balance at the ECB, Luxembourg\\'s Yves Mersch was appointed as González-Páramo\\'s replacement.In December 2020, Frank Elderson succeeded to Yves Mersch at the ECB\\'s board.\\n\\n\\n==== Governing Council ====\\nThe Governing Council is the main decision-making body of the Eurosystem. It comprises the members of the executive board (six in total) and the governors of the National Central Banks of the euro area countries (20 as of 2023).\\nAccording to Article 284 of the TFEU, the President of the European Council and a representative from the European Commission may attend the meetings as observers, but they lack voting rights.\\nSince January 2015, the ECB has published on its website a summary of the Governing Council deliberations (\"accounts\"). These publications came as a partial response to recurring criticism against the ECB\\'s opacity. However, in contrast to other central banks, the ECB still does not disclose individual voting records of the governors seating in its council.\\n\\n\\n==== General Council ====\\nThe General Council is a body dealing with transitional issues of euro adoption, for example, fixing the exchange rates of currencies being replaced by the euro (continuing the tasks of the former EMI). It will continue to exist until all EU member states adopt the euro, at which point it will be dissolved. It is composed of the President and vice-president together with the governors of all of the EU\\'s national central banks.\\n\\n\\n==== Supervisory Board ====\\nThe ECB Supervisory Board meets twice a month to discuss, plan and carry out the ECB\\'s supervisory tasks. It proposes draft decisions to the Governing Council under the non-objection procedure. It is composed of Chair (appointed for a non-renewable term of five years), Vice-chair (chosen from among the members of the ECB\\'s executive board) four ECB representatives and representatives of national supervisors. If the national supervisory authority designated by a Member State is not a national central bank (NCB), the representative of the competent authority can be accompanied by a representative from their NCB. In such cases, the representatives are together considered as one member for the purposes of the voting procedure.It also includes the Steering Committee, which supports the activities of the supervisory board and prepares the Board\\'s meetings. It is composed by the chair of the supervisory board, Vice-chair of the supervisory board, one ECB representative and five representatives of national supervisors. The five representatives of national supervisors are appointed by the supervisory board for one year based on a rotation system that ensures a fair representation of countries.\\n\\n\\n=== Capital subscription ===\\nThe ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its initial capital was supposed to be €5 billion and the initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the member states\\' populations and GDP, but the key is adjustable. The euro area NCBs were required to pay their respective subscriptions to the ECB\\'s capital in full. The NCBs of the non-participating countries have had to pay 7% of their respective subscriptions to the ECB\\'s capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB. As a result, the ECB was endowed with an initial capital of just under €4 billion. The capital is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral. The NCBs are the sole subscribers to and holders of the capital of the ECB.\\nToday, ECB capital is about €11 billion, which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. The NCBs\\' shares in this capital are calculated using a capital key which reflects the respective member\\'s share in the total population and gross domestic product of the EU. The ECB adjusts the shares every five years and whenever the number of contributing NCBs changes. The adjustment is made on the basis of data provided by the European Commission.\\nAll national central banks (NCBs) that own a share of the ECB capital stock as of 1 February 2020 are listed below. Non-Euro area NCBs are required to pay up only a very small percentage of their subscribed capital, which accounts for the different magnitudes of Euro area and Non-Euro area total paid-up capital.\\n\\n\\n=== Reserves ===\\nIn addition to capital subscriptions, the NCBs of the member states participating in the euro area provided the ECB with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around €40 billion. The contributions of each NCB is in proportion to its share in the ECB\\'s subscribed capital, while in return each NCB is credited by the ECB with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution. 15% of the contributions was made in gold, and the remaining 85% in US dollars and UK pounds sterling.\\n\\n\\n=== Languages ===\\nThe internal working language of the ECB is English, and press conferences are held in English. External communications are handled flexibly: English is preferred (though not exclusively) for communication within the ESCB (i.e. with other central banks) and with financial markets; communication with other national bodies and with EU citizens is normally in their respective language, but the ECB website is predominantly English; official documents such as the Annual Report are in the official languages of the EU (generally English, German and French).In 2022, the ECB publishes for the first time details on the nationality of its staff, revealing an over-representation of Germans and Italians along the ECB employees, including in management positions.\\n\\n\\n=== Independence ===\\nThe European Central Bank (and by extension, the Eurosystem) is often considered as the \"most independent central bank in the world\". In general terms, this means that the Eurosystem tasks and policies can be discussed, designed, decided and implemented in full autonomy, without pressure or need for instructions from any external body. The main justification for the ECB\\'s independence is that such an institutional setup assists the maintenance of price stability.In practice, the ECB\\'s independence is pinned by four key principles:\\nOperational and legal independence: the ECB has all required competences to achieve its price stability mandate and thereby can steer monetary policy in full autonomy and by means of high level of discretion. The ECB\\'s governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy, since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public (leading to suspicions that Governing Council members are voting along national lines.) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB\\'s own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be the party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit.\\nPersonal independence: the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years. In addition, ECB board members are vastly immune from judicial proceedings. Indeed, removals from the office can only be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), under the request of the ECB\\'s Governing Council or the executive board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such a decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem\\'s national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with a possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.\\nFinancial independence: the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB\\'s financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct monetary financing of public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.\\nPolitical independence: The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. Symmetrically, EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB\\'s independence. It is the latter which is the subject of much debate.\\n\\n\\n=== Democratic accountability ===\\nIn return to its high degree of independence and discretion, the ECB is accountable to the European Parliament (and to a lesser extent to the European Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU)). Although the accountability mechanisms are not enshrined in EU law, several practices were established following a resolution of the European Parliament adopted in 1998, which were informally agreed by the ECB, and incorporated into the Parliament\\'s rule of procedure. In 2023, the European Parliament and the ECB made these accountability arrangements were made more formal by signing an exchange of letter.The accountability framework involves five main mechanisms:\\nAnnual report: the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Council . The report is presented to the European parliament at the occasion of a specific hearing with the ECB\\'s Vice-President at the ECON committee.\\nAnnual parliamentary resolution: in return, the European Parliament evaluates the past activities to the ECB via its own annual resolution on the European Central Bank\\'s report (which is essentially a non-legally-binding list of resolutions). Since 2016, the ECB replies to the Parliament\\'s suggestions in an annex to its annual report.\\nQuarterly hearings  (known as the \"Monetary Dialogue\"): the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament organises a hearing with the ECB every quarter, allowing members of parliament to address oral questions to the ECB president.\\nParliamentary questions: all Members of the European Parliament have the right to address written questions to the ECB president. The ECB president provides a written answer in about six weeks.\\nAppointments: The European Parliament is consulted during the appointment process of executive board members of the ECB. However the Parliament\\'s vote is only consultative, and in practice, the Parliament\\'s opinion – when negative – has been ignored by the European Council.\\nLegal proceedings: the ECB\\'s legal personality allows civil society or public institutions to file complaints against the ECB to the Court of Justice of the EU.In 2013, an interinstitutional agreement was reached between the ECB and the European Parliament in the context of the establishment of the ECB\\'s Banking Supervision. This agreement sets broader powers to the European Parliament than the established practice on the monetary policy side of the ECB\\'s activities. For example, under the agreement, the Parliament can veto the appointment of the chair and vice-chair of the ECB\\'s supervisory board and may approve removals if requested by the ECB.\\n\\n\\n=== Transparency ===\\nIn addition to its independence, the ECB is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to EU Institutions standards and other major central banks. Indeed, as pointed out by Transparency International, \"The Treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the EU and its institutions. They do, however, grant the ECB a partial exemption from these principles. According to Art. 15(3) TFEU, the ECB is bound by the EU\\'s transparency principles \"only when exercising [its] administrative tasks\" (the exemption – which leaves the term \"administrative tasks\" undefined – equally applies to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the European Investment Bank).\"In practice, there are several concrete examples where the ECB is less transparent than other institutions:\\n\\nVoting secrecy: while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers, the ECB\\'s Governing Council decisions are made in full discretion. Since 2014, the ECB has published \"accounts\" of its monetary policy meetings, but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes.\\nAccess to documents: The obligation for EU bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ECB. However, under the ECB\\'s Rules of Procedure, the Governing Council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30 years.\\nDisclosure of securities: The ECB is less transparent than the Fed when it comes to disclosing the list of securities being held in its balance sheet under monetary policy operations such as QE.\\n\\n\\n== Location ==\\n\\nThe bank is based in Ostend (East End), Frankfurt am Main. The city is the largest financial centre in the Eurozone and the bank\\'s location in it is fixed by the Amsterdam Treaty. The bank moved to a new purpose-built headquarters in 2014, designed by a Vienna-based architectural office, Coop Himmelbau. The building is approximately 180 metres (591 ft) tall and is to be accompanied by other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of Frankfurt am Main. The main construction on a 120,000 m2 total site area began in October 2008, and it was expected that the building would become an architectural symbol for Europe. While it was designed to accommodate double the number of staff who operated in the former Eurotower, that building has been retained by the ECB, owing to more space being required since it took responsibility for banking supervision.\\n\\n\\n== Debates surrounding the ECB ==\\n\\n\\n=== Debates on ECB independence ===\\nThe debate on the independence of the ECB finds its origins in the preparatory stages of the construction of the EMU. The German government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected, such as a European Central Bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the German central bank. The French government, for its part, feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process. A compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ECB and the Council of Finance Ministers of the euro area, the Eurogroupe.\\n\\n\\n==== Arguments in favour of independence ====\\nThere is strong consensus among economists on the value of central bank independence from politics. The rationale behind are both empirical and theoretical. On the theoretical side, it\\'s believed that time inconsistency suggests the existence of political business cycles where elected officials might take advantage of policy surprises to secure reelection. The politician up to the election will therefore be incentivized to introduce expansionary monetary policies, reducing unemployment in the short run. These effects will be most likely temporary. By contrast, in the long run, it will increase inflation, with unemployment returning to the natural rate negating the positive effect. Furthermore, the credibility of the central bank will deteriorate, making it more difficult to answer the market. Additionally, empirical work has been done that defined and measured central bank independence (CBI), looking at the relationship of CBI with inflation.\\n\\n\\n==== The arguments against too much independence ====\\n\\n\\n===== An independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. =====\\nDemystify the independence of central bankers: According to Christopher Adolph (2009), the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal façade and not an indisputable fact. To achieve this, the author analyses the professional careers of central bankers and mirrors them with their respective monetary decision-making. To explain the results of his analysis, he utilizes he uses the \"principal-agent\" theory. To explain that in order to create a new entity, one needs a delegator or principal (in this case the heads of state or government of the euro area) and a delegate or agent (in this case the ECB). In his illustration, he describes the financial community as a \"shadow principale\"  which influences the choice of central bankers thus indicating that the central banks indeed act as interfaces between the financial world and the States. It is therefore not surprising, still according to the author, to regain their influence and preferences in the appointment of central bankers, presumed conservative, neutral and impartial according to the model of the Independent Central Bank (ICB), which eliminates this famous \"temporal inconsistency\". Central bankers had a professional life before joining the central bank and their careers will most likely continue after their tenure. They are ultimately human beings. Therefore, for the author, central bankers have interests of their own, based on their past careers and their expectations after joining the ECB, and try to send messages to their future potential employers.\\nThe crisis: an opportunity to impose its will and extend its powers:\\n– Its participation in the troika: Thanks to its three factors which explain its independence, the ECB took advantage of this crisis to implement, through its participation in the troika, the famous structural reforms in the Member States aimed at making, more flexible the various markets, particularly the labour market, which are still considered too rigid under the ordoliberal concept.- Macro-prudential supervision : At the same time, taking advantage of the reform of the financial supervision system, the Frankfurt Bank has acquired new responsibilities, such as macro-prudential supervision, in other words, supervision of the provision of financial services.-Take liberties with its mandate to save the Euro : Paradoxically, the crisis undermined the ECB\\'s ordoliberal discourse \"because some of its instruments, which it had to implement, deviated significantly from its principles. It then interpreted the paradigm with enough flexibly to adapt its original reputation to these new economic conditions. It was forced to do so as a last resort to save its one and only raison d\\'être: the euro. This Independent was thus obliged to be pragmatic by departing from the spirit of its statutes, which is unacceptable to the hardest supporters of ordoliberalism, which will lead to the resignation of the two German leaders present within the ECB: the governor of the Bundesbank, Jens WEIDMANN and the member of the executive board of the ECB, Jürgen STARK.– Regulation of the financial system : The delegation of this new function to the ECB was carried out with great simplicity and with the consent of European leaders, because neither the Commission nor the Member States really wanted to obtain the monitoring of financial abuses throughout the area. In other words, in the event of a new financial crisis, the ECB would be the perfect scapegoat.- Capturing exchange rate policy : The event that will most mark the definitive politicization of the ECB is, of course, the operation launched in January 2015: the quantitative easing (QE) operation. Indeed, the Euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the Euro zone is at risk of deflation. In addition, Member States find themselves heavily indebted, partly due to the rescue of their national banks. The ECB, as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone, is deciding to gradually buy back more than EUR 1 100 billion Member States\\' public debt. In this way, money is injected back into the economy, the euro depreciates significantly, prices rise, the risk of deflation is removed, and Member States reduce their debts. However, the ECB has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the Treaties or with the approval of European leaders, and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this.In conclusion, for those in favour of a framework for ECB independence, there is a clear concentration of powers. In the light of these facts, it is clear that the ECB is no longer the simple guardian of monetary stability in the euro area, but has become, over the course of the crisis, a \"multi-competent economic player, at ease in this role that no one, especially not the agnostic governments of the euro Member States, seems to have the idea of challenging\". This new political super-actor, having captured many spheres of competence and a very strong influence in the economic field in the broad sense (economy, finance, budget...).  This new political super-actor can no longer act alone and refuse a counter-power, consubstantial to our liberal democracies. Indeed, the status of independence which the ECB enjoys by essence should not exempt it from a real responsibility regarding the democratic process.\\n\\n\\n===== The arguments in favour of a counter power =====\\nIn the aftermath of the euro area crisis, several proposals for a countervailing power were put forward, to deal with criticisms of a democratic deficit. For the German economist German Issing (2001) the ECB as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent. According to him, this transparency could bring several advantages as the improvement of efficiency and credibility by giving the public adequate information. Others think that the ECB should have a closer relationship with the European Parliament which could play a major role in the evaluation of the democratic responsibility of the ECB. The development of new institutions or the creation of a minister is another solution proposed:\\nA minister for the Eurozone ?\\nThe idea of a eurozone finance minister is regularly raised and supported by certain political figures, including Emmanuel Macron, as well as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former President of the ECB Jean-Claude Trichet and former European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. For the latter, this position would bring \"more democratic legitimacy\" and \"more efficiency\" to European politics. In his view, it is a question of merging the powers of Commissioner for the Economy and Finance with those of the President of the Eurogroup.The main task of this minister would be to \"represent a strong political authority protecting the economic and budgetary interests of the euro area as a whole, and not the interests of individual Member States\". According to the Jacques Delors Institute, its competencies could be as follows:\\n\\nSupervising the coordination of economic and budgetary policies\\nEnforcing the rules in case of infringement\\nConducting negotiations in a crisis context\\nContributing to cushioning regional shocks\\nRepresenting the euro area in international institutions and foraFor Jean-Claude Trichet, this minister could also rely on the Eurogroup working group for the preparation and follow-up of meetings in eurozone format, and on the Economic and Financial Committee for meetings concerning all Member States. He would also have under his authority a General Secretariat of the Treasury of the euro area, whose tasks would be determined by the objectives of the budgetary union currently being set up This proposal was nevertheless rejected in 2017 by the Eurogroup, its president, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, spoke of the importance of this institution in relation to the European Commission.Towards democratic institutions ?\\nThe absence of democratic institutions such as a Parliament or a real government is a regular criticism of the ECB in its management of the euro area, and many proposals have been made in this respect, particularly after the economic crisis, which would have shown the need to improve the governance of the euro area. For Moïse Sidiropoulos, a professor in economy: \"The crisis in the euro zone came as no surprise, because the euro remains an unfinished currency, a stateless currency with a fragile political legitimacy\".French economist Thomas Piketty wrote on his blog in 2017 that it was essential to equip the eurozone with democratic institutions. An economic government could for example enable it to have a common budget, common taxes and borrowing and investment capacities. Such a government would then make the euro area more democratic and transparent by avoiding the opacity of a council such as the Eurogroup.\\nNevertheless, according to him \"there is no point in talking about a government of the eurozone if we do not say to which democratic body this government will be accountable\", a real parliament of the eurozone to which a finance minister would be accountable seems to be the real priority for the economist, who also denounces the lack of action in this area.The creation of a sub-committee within the current European Parliament was also mentioned, in the model of the Eurogroup, which is currently an under-formation of the ECOFIN Committee. This would require a simple amendment to the rules of procedure and would avoid a competitive situation between two separate parliamentary assemblies. The former President of the European Commission had, moreover, stated on this subject that he had \"no sympathy for the idea of a specific Eurozone Parliament\".\\n\\n\\n==== Debates on the role of central bank reserves in monetary policy ====\\nIn \"Towards monetary policies that do not subsidise banks\" published in July 2023 and co-authored with Yuemei Ji, Paul de Grauwe criticizes the prevailing role of central bank reserves in monetary policy. Holding the John Paulson Chair in European Political Economy at the London School of Economics, de Grauwe presented his views on this matter in a lecture at the Bundesbank in September 2023.De Grauwe states that major central banks are currently operating in a regime of abundance of bank reserves. This abundance, he argues, is a consequence of massive government bond-buying programs and a fundamental change in the operating procedures of these central banks. Since late 2021, in response to rising interest rates aimed at combating inflation, central banks have adopted a procedure of increasing interest rates by raising the remuneration on bank reserves. This approach has resulted in substantial interest payments to commercial banks. Due to past Quantitative Easing, bank reserves are now massive, leading to huge transfers of profits. Paul de Grauwe highlights the magnitude of these interest payments, comparing them to significant public expenditures:  the interests received by commercial banks to the yearly spending of the EU (€165 billion) to the interest payments of the ECB during the same period (€152 billion).\\nDe Grauwe argues that these transfers lack economic rationale. Despite seigniorage gains traditionally returning to the government, he observes that central banks are transferring more than the total seigniorage gains to private banks, resulting in significant losses and effectively constituting a subsidy to banks at the expense of taxpayers.\\nFurthermore, the author raises concerns about moral hazard, noting that the provision of free interest hedging for banks by central banks may create ethical issues, as public authorities offer free insurance to private agents.\\nQuestioning the economic rationale for these practices, de Grauwe states that the remuneration of bank reserves is not totally necessary for conducting monetary policy and that the regime of reserve abundance is a result of the oversupply of reserves created by central banks through the buying of large amounts of government bonds. Now, central banks cannot raise the interest rate without remunerating bank reserves, the equilibrium of demand (commercial blanks) and supply (central banks) being under the 0% rate. De Grauwe also states that the reserve abundance regime has altered the view of economists on the role of central banks : money base created by the central bank is now viewed as part of the public debt since central banks must pay a rate of remuneration on bank reserves. According to de Grauwe, this view is not inevitable and he suggests alternative operating procedures to address these issues : a gradual return to a regime of scarce reserves through Quantitative Tightening, raising minimum reserve requirements without paying interest on bank reserves, and implementing a two-tier system of reserve requirements to control the market rate while reducing transfers to commercial banks.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nEuropean Banking Authority\\nEuropean Systemic Risk Board\\nOpen market operation\\nEconomic and Monetary Union\\nCapital Markets Union\\nEuropean banking union\\nList of central banks\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website',\n",
       " 'The human back, also called the dorsum (pl.: dorsa), is the large posterior area of the human body, rising from the top of the buttocks to the back of the neck. It is the surface of the body opposite from the chest and the abdomen. The vertebral column runs the length of the back and creates a central area of recession. The breadth of the back is created by the shoulders at the top and the pelvis at the bottom.\\nBack pain is a common medical condition, generally benign in origin.\\n\\n\\n== Structure ==\\nThe central feature of the human back is the vertebral column, specifically the length from the top of the thoracic vertebrae to the bottom of the lumbar vertebrae, which houses the spinal cord in its spinal canal, and which generally has some curvature that gives shape to the back. The ribcage extends from the spine at the top of the back (with the top of the ribcage corresponding to the T1 vertebra), more than halfway down the length of the back, leaving an area with less protection between the bottom of the ribcage and the hips. The width of the back at the top is defined by the scapula, the broad, flat bones of the shoulders.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Muscles ===\\nThe muscles of the back can be divided into three distinct groups; a superficial group, an intermediate group and a deep group.\\n\\n\\n==== Superficial group ====\\nThe superficial group, also known as the appendicular group, is primarily associated with movement of the appendicular skeleton. It is composed of trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid major, rhomboid minor and levator scapulae. It is innervated by anterior rami of spinal nerves, reflecting its embryological origin outside the back.\\n\\n\\n==== Intermediate group ====\\nThe intermediate group is also known as respiratory group as it may serve a respiratory function. It is composed of serratus posterior superior and serratus posterior inferior. Like the superficial group, it is innervated by anterior rami of spinal nerves.\\n\\n\\n==== Deep group ====\\nThe deep group, also known as the intrinsic group due to its embryological origin in the back, can be further subdivided into four groups:\\n\\nSpinotransversales –  composed of splenius capitis and splenius cervicis.\\nErector spinae –  composed of iliocostalis, longissismus and spinalis\\nTransversospinales –  composed of semispinalis, multifidus and rotatores\\nSegmental muscles –  composed of levatores costarum, interspinales and intertransversariiThe deep group is innervated by the posterior rami of spinal nerves.\\n\\n\\n=== Organs near the back ===\\nThe lungs are within the ribcage, and extend to the back of the ribcage making it possible for them to be listened into through the back. The kidneys are situated beneath the muscles in the area below the end of the ribcage, loosely connected to the peritoneum. A strike to the lower back can damage the kidneys of the person being hit.\\n\\n\\n=== Surface of the back ===\\nThe skin of the human back is thicker and has fewer nerve endings than the skin on any other part of the torso. With some notable exceptions (see, e.g., George \"the Animal\" Steele), it tends to have less hair than the chest on men. The upper-middle back is also the one area of the body which a typical human under normal conditions might be unable to physically touch.\\nThe skin of the back is innervated by the dorsal cutaneous branches, as well as the lateral abdominal cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement ===\\nThe intricate anatomy of the back provides support for the head and trunk of the body, strength in the trunk of the body, as well as a great deal of flexibility and movement. The upper back has the most structural support, with the ribs attached firmly to each level of the thoracic spine and very limited movement. The lower back (lumbar vertebrae) allows for flexibility and movement in back bending (extension) and forward bending (flexion). It does not permit twisting.\\n\\n\\n== Clinical significance ==\\n\\n\\n=== Back pain ===\\n\\nThe back comprises interconnecting nerves, bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons, all of which can be a source of pain. Back pain is the second most common type of pain in adults (the most common being headaches). By far the most common cause of back pain is muscle strain. The back muscles can usually heal themselves within a couple of weeks, but the pain can be intense and debilitating. Other common sources of back pain include disc problems, such as degenerative disc disease or a lumbar disc herniation, many types of fractures, such as spondylolisthesis or an osteoporotic fracture, or osteoarthritis.\\n\\n\\n== Society and culture ==\\nThe curvature of the female back is a frequent theme in paintings, because the sensibilities of many cultures permit the back to be shown nude - implying full nudity without actually displaying it. Indeed, the practice of showing explicitness on the lower back has been performed for centuries. Certain articles of clothing, such as the haltertop and the backless dress, are designed to expose the back in this manner. The lower back is typically exposed frequently by many types of shirts in woman\\'s fashion, and even the more conservative shirts and blouses will reveal the lower back. This happens for a variety of reasons- the lower waist area is a pivot point for the body and lengthens and arches as a person sits or bends. Secondly, woman\\'s fashion typically favors tops that are waist length, allowing the back to be left bare during slight movement, bending or sitting. The back also serves as the largest canvas for body art on the human body. Because of its size and the relative lack of hair, the back presents an ideal canvas on the human body for lower back tattoos, mostly among young women. Indeed, some individuals have tattoos that cover the entirety of the back. Others have smaller tattoos at significant locations, such as the shoulder blade or the bottom of the back.\\nThe part of the back that typically cannot be reached to be scratched is sometimes named acnestis.\\nAn itch there can be irritant, leading to the development and use of backscratchers.\\nMany English idioms mention the back, usually highlighting it as an area of vulnerability; one must \"watch one\\'s back\", or one may end up \"with one\\'s back up against the wall\"; worse yet, someone may \"stab one in the back\", but hopefully a friend \"has got one\\'s back\".\\n\"Wetback\" is a derogatory name in American English for immigrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally (purportedly swimming though the Rio Grande).\\nThe back is also a symbol of strength and hard work, with those seeking physical labor looking for \"strong backs\", and workers being implored to \"put their back into it\".\\nHistorically, flagellation of a person across the back with a whip was both a common form of punishment of criminals, and a common means of forcing slaves to work. As well, self-flagellation, as in self punishment, may include the use of whipping oneself. This is one method of mortification, the practice of inflicting physical suffering on oneself with the religious belief that it will serve as penance for one\\'s own sins or those of others. While more moderate forms of mortification are widely practiced—particularly in the Catholic Church—self flagellation is not encouraged by mainstream religions or religious leaders. A well-known instrument used for flagellations is the infamous Cat \\'o Nine Tails, a nine-corded whip with one handle enabling a much more effective whipping than would be possible with only one lashing at a time.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
       " 'Fintech, a clipped compound of \"financial technology\", refers to firms using new technology to compete with traditional financial methods in the delivery of financial services. Artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data are regarded as the \"ABCD\" (four key areas) of fintech. The use of smartphones for mobile banking, investing, borrowing services, and cryptocurrency are examples of technologies designed to make financial services more accessible to the general public. Fintech companies consist of both startups and established financial institutions and technology companies trying to replace or enhance the usage of financial services provided by existing financial companies.\\n\\n\\n== Key areas ==\\n\\n\\n=== Academics ===\\nArtificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, cloud computing, and big data are considered the four key areas of fintech. Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast with “natural intelligence” displayed by humans and animals. AI is assuming an increasingly important role in traditional banking and finance as it provides technologies such as voice recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision for user-account management, machine learning methods, and deep learning networks for anti-money laundering, fraud detection and credit modeling. Mobile and internet payment systems are closely connected to cloud computing. The past ten years have witnessed increasing adoption of cloud computing by financial institutions around the globe.\\n\\n\\n=== Industry ===\\nFinancial technology has been used to automate investments, insurance, trading, banking services and risk management.Robo-advisers are a class of automated financial adviser that provide financial advice or investment management online with moderate to very little human intervention. They provide digital financial advice based on mathematical rules or algorithms and can even create and manage automated investment portfolios. This can provide a lower-cost alternative to a human adviser and also has the ability to avoid human error and bias.Global investment in financial technology increased more than 12,000% from $930 million in 2008 to $121.6 billion in 2020.  2019 saw a record high with the total global investment in financial technology being $215.3 billion, of which Q3 alone accounted for $144.7 billion in investment.In H1 2021, fintech deal volume hit 2,456 deals accounting for $98 billion in investment. Global VC investment was higher than $52 billion in H1’21, close to the annual record of $54 billion seen in 2018.H1’21 saw $21 billion in corporate-affiliated VC investment. CVC deal volume reached a high of 284 in Q1’21, and then grew further to 312 in Q2’21.The Americas saw about $51.4 billion of fintech investment in H1’21, with the US alone accounting for $42.1 billion. In the EMEA region, investment in fintech was very robust at $39.1 billion. In Asia-Pacific, fintech investment grew between H2’20 and H1’21—rising from $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion, although it was subdued in comparison with previous record highs.The nascent financial technology industry in London has seen rapid growth over the last few years, according to the office of the Mayor of London. Forty percent of the City of London\\'s workforce is employed in financial and technology services. As of April 2019, about 76,500 people form the UK-wide FinTech workforce, and this number is projected to rise to 105,500 by 2030. Of the current fintech workforce in the UK, 42% of workers are from overseas.In Europe, $1.5 billion was invested in financial technology companies in 2014, with London-based companies receiving $539 million, Amsterdam-based companies $306 million, and Stockholm-based companies receiving $266 million in investment. After London, Stockholm is the second highest funded city in Europe in the past 10 years. Europe\\'s fintech deals reached a five-quarter high, rising from 37 in Q4 2015 to 47 in Q1 2016. Lithuania is starting to become a northern European hub for financial technology companies since the news in 2016 about the exit of Britain from the European Union. Lithuania has issued 51 fintech licenses since 2016, 32 of those in 2017.Fintech companies in the United States raised $12.4 billion in 2018, a 43% increase over 2017 figures.\\nIn the Asia Pacific region, the growth will see a new financial technology hub to be opened in Sydney, in April 2015. According to KPMG, Sydney\\'s financial services sector in 2017 creates 9 per cent of national GDP and is bigger than the financial services sector in either Hong Kong or Singapore. A financial technology innovation lab was launched in Hong Kong in 2015.  In 2015, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched an initiative named Fintech and Information Group to draw in start-ups from around the world. It pledged to spend $225 million in the fintech sector over the next five years.While Singapore has been one of the central fintech hubs in Asia, start ups in the sector from Vietnam and Indonesia have been attracting more venture capital investments in recent years. Since 2014, Southeast Asian fintech companies have increased VC funding from $35 million to $679 million in 2018 and $1.14 billion in 2019.Africa\\'s overall fintech sector has expanded quickly. There were more than 1000 active businesses as of April 2022, up from 450 in 2020. The venture capital sector, which saw deal value rise from $485 million in 2020 to $3.23 billion in 2021, was mostly responsible for the increase in investment in Africa. About half of this investment was made in fintech with Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa remaining key markets in the West, East, and South respectively. \\n\\n\\n== Technologies ==\\nFintech companies use a variety of technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), big data, robotic process automation (RPA), and blockchain.\\nAI algorithms can provide insight into customer spending habits, allowing financial institutions to better understand their clients. Chatbots are another AI-driven tool that banks are starting to use to help with customer service. AI enables personalized financial services, enhanced fraud prevention, financial inclusion, and sustainable investing. It\\'s anticipated to drive massive value creation in the fintech sector, notably in predictive finance and automated decision-making. Advancements in deep learning and large language models (LLM) are pivotal for AI-driven investment strategies, enabling real-time market adjustments and personalized investment strategies tailored to individual risk profiles. Furthermore, AI and Machine Learning (ML) contribute to improved efficiency, better risk management, cost savings, and an enhanced customer experience in financial institutions.Big data can predict client investments and market changes in order to create new strategies and portfolios, analyze customer spending habits, improve fraud detection, and create marketing strategies.Robotic Process Automation is an artificial intelligence technology that focuses on automating specific repetitive tasks. RPA helps to process financial information such as accounts payable and receivable more efficiently than the manual process and often more accurately.Blockchain is an emerging technology in finance which has driven significant investment from many companies. The decentralized nature of blockchain can eliminate the need for a third party to execute transactions.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and recognition ==\\nFinancial magazine Forbes created a list of the leading disruptors in financial technology for its Forbes 2021 Global Fintech 50. In Europe there is a list called the FinTech 50, which aims to recognise the most innovative companies in fintech.A report published in February 2016 by EY commissioned by the UK Treasury compared seven leading fintech hubs: the United Kingdom, California, New York City, Singapore, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong. It ranked California first for \\'talent\\' and \\'capital\\', the United Kingdom first for \\'government policy\\', and New York City first for \\'demand\\'.For the past few years, PwC has posted a report called the \"Global Fintech Report\". The 2019 report covers many topics of the financial technology sector, describing the landscape of the fintech industry, and some of the emerging technologies in the sector. And it provides strategies for financial institutions on how to incorporate more \"fintech\" technologies into their business.\\n\\n\\n== Outlook ==\\nFinance is seen as one of the industries most vulnerable to disruption by software because financial services, much like publishing, are made of information rather than concrete goods. In particular blockchains have the potential to reduce the cost of transacting in a financial system.  While finance has been shielded by regulation until now, and weathered the dot-com boom without major upheaval, a new wave of startups is increasingly \"disaggregating\" global banks. However, aggressive enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act and money transmission regulations represents an ongoing threat to fintech companies. In response, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank jointly presented Bali Fintech Agenda on October 11, 2018 which consists of 12 policy elements acting as a guidelines for various governments and central banking institutions to adopt and deploy \"rapid advances in financial technology\".The New York Venture Capital Association (NYVCA) hosts annual summits to educate those interested in learning more about fintech. In 2018 alone, fintech was responsible for over 1,700 deals worth over 40 billion dollars. In 2021, one in every five dollars invested by venture capital has gone into fintech.\\n\\n\\n== Challenges and solutions ==\\nIn addition to established competitors, fintech companies often face doubts from financial regulators like issuing banks and national governments. In July 2018, the Trump Administration in the United States issued a policy statement that allowed fintech companies to apply for special purpose national bank charters from the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Federal preemption applies to state law regarding federally chartered banks.Data security is another issue regulators are concerned about because of the threat of hacking as well as the need to protect sensitive consumer and corporate financial data. Leading global fintech companies are proactively turning to cloud technology to meet increasingly stringent compliance regulations.The Federal Trade Commission provides free resources for corporations of all sizes to meet their legal obligations of protecting sensitive data. Several private initiatives suggest that multiple layers of defense can help isolate and secure financial data.In the European Union, fintech companies must adhere to data protection laws, such as GDPR. Companies need to proactively protect users and companies data or face fines of 20 million euros, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of their total global turnover. In addition to GDPR, European financial institutions including fintech firms have to update their regulatory affairs departments with the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), meaning they must organise their revenue structure around a central goal of privacy.Any data breach, no matter how small, can result in direct liability to a company (see the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) and ruin a fintech company\\'s reputation.The online financial sector is also an increasing target of distributed denial of service extortion attacks. This security challenge is also faced by historical bank companies since they do offer Internet-connected customer services.Many fintech technologies have very high start-up costs but very low marginal costs for adding additional customers, effectively necessitating many fintech companies to act as natural monopolies.\\n\\n\\n== European regulation on fintechs ==\\nEuropean Regulation on Fintechs refers to the body of laws, directives, and guidelines that govern the operation, development, and innovation of financial technology (fintech) companies in the European Union (EU). As the fintech sector has rapidly evolved in recent years, the European Commission and European Parliament have introduced various regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability, promote innovation, and protect consumer interests. These frameworks aim to create a single market for fintech services, while also addressing the emerging risks and challenges associated with new financial technologies.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nArtificial intelligence in finance\\nFintech in Australia\\nSmart contract\\nTrade finance technology\\n\\n\\n== References and notes ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nTeigland, R.; Siri, S.; Larsson, A.; Puertas, A.

       " 'The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a major financial agency of the United Nations, and an international financial institution funded by 190 member countries, with headquarters in Washington, D.C. It is regarded as the global lender of last resort to national governments, and a leading supporter of exchange-rate stability. Its stated mission is \"working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.\" Established on December 27, 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference, primarily according to the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, it started with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international monetary system after World War II. It now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises. Through a quota system, countries contribute funds to a pool from which countries can borrow if they experience balance of payments problems. As of 2016, the fund had SDR 477 billion (about US$667 billion).The IMF works to stabilize and foster the economies of its member countries by its use of the fund, as well as other activities such as gathering and analyzing economic statistics and surveillance of its members\\' economies. IMF funds come from two major sources: quotas and loans. Quotas, which are pooled funds from member nations, generate most IMF funds. The size of members\\' quotas increase according to their economic and financial importance in the world. The quotas are increased periodically as a means of boosting the IMF\\'s resources in the form of special drawing rights.The current managing director (MD) and chairwoman of the IMF is Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva, who has held the post since October 1, 2019. Indian-American economist Gita Gopinath, previously the chief economist, was appointed as first deputy managing director, effective January 21, 2022. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas was appointed chief economist on January 24, 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Functions ==\\nAccording to the IMF itself, it works to foster global growth and economic stability by providing policy advice and financing the members by working with developing countries to help them achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty. The rationale for this is that private international capital markets function imperfectly and many countries have limited access to financial markets. Such market imperfections, together with balance-of-payments financing, provide the justification for official financing, without which many countries could only correct large external payment imbalances through measures with adverse economic consequences. The IMF provides alternate sources of financing such as the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.Upon the founding of the IMF, its three primary functions were: \\n\\nto oversee the fixed exchange rate arrangements between countries, thus helping national governments manage their exchange rates and allowing these governments to prioritize economic growth, and\\nto provide short-term capital to aid the balance of payments and prevent the spread of international economic crises.\\nto help mend the pieces of the international economy after the Great Depression and World War II as well as to provide capital investments for economic growth and projects such as infrastructure.The IMF\\'s role was fundamentally altered by the floating exchange rates after 1971. It shifted to examining the economic policies of countries with IMF loan agreements to determine whether a shortage of capital was due to economic fluctuations or economic policy. The IMF also researched what types of government policy would ensure economic recovery. A particular concern of the IMF was to prevent financial crises, such as those in Mexico in 1982, Brazil in 1987, East Asia in 1997–98, and Russia in 1998, from spreading and threatening the entire global financial and currency system. The challenge was to promote and implement a policy that reduced the frequency of crises among emerging market countries, especially the middle-income countries which are vulnerable to massive capital outflows. Rather than maintaining a position of oversight of only exchange rates, their function became one of surveillance of the overall macroeconomic performance of member countries. Their role became a lot more active because the IMF now manages economic policy rather than just exchange rates.In addition, the IMF negotiates conditions on lending and loans under their policy of conditionality, which was established in the 1950s. Low-income countries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Non-concessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through the Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.\\n\\n\\n=== Surveillance of the global economy ===\\nThe IMF is mandated to oversee the international monetary and financial system and monitor the economic and financial policies of its member countries. This activity is known as surveillance and facilitates international co-operation. Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s, surveillance has evolved largely by way of changes in procedures rather than through the adoption of new obligations. The responsibilities changed from those of guardians to those of overseers of members\\' policies.The Fund typically analyses the appropriateness of each member country\\'s economic and financial policies for achieving orderly economic growth, and assesses the consequences of these policies for other countries and for the global economy. For instance, The IMF played a significant role in individual countries, such as Armenia and Belarus, in providing financial support to achieve stabilization financing from 2009 to 2019. The maximum sustainable debt level of a polity, which is watched closely by the IMF, was defined in 2011 by IMF economists to be 120%. Indeed, it was at this number that the Greek economy melted down in 2010.\\nIn 1995, the International Monetary Fund began to work on data dissemination standards with the view of guiding IMF member countries to disseminate their economic and financial data to the public. The International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) endorsed the guidelines for the dissemination standards and they were split into two tiers: The General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).The executive board approved the SDDS and GDDS in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and subsequent amendments were published in a revised Guide to the General Data Dissemination System. The system is aimed primarily at statisticians and aims to improve many aspects of statistical systems in a country. It is also part of the World Bank Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Poverty Reduction Strategic Papers (PRSPs).The primary objective of the GDDS is to encourage member countries to build a framework to improve data quality and statistical capacity building to evaluate statistical needs, set priorities in improving timeliness, transparency, reliability, and accessibility of financial and economic data. Some countries initially used the GDDS, but later upgraded to SDDS.Some entities that are not IMF members also contribute statistical data to the systems:\\n\\nPalestinian Authority – GDDS\\nHong Kong – SDDS\\nMacau – GDDS\\nInstitutions of the European Union:\\nThe European Central Bank for the Eurozone – SDDS\\nEurostat for the whole EU – SDDS, thus providing data from Cyprus (not using any DDSystem on its own) and Malta (using only GDDS on its own)A 2021 study found that the IMF\\'s surveillance activities have \"a substantial impact on sovereign debt with much greater impacts in emerging than high-income economies\".\\n\\n\\n=== World Economic Outlook ===\\nWorld Economic Outlook is a survey, published twice a year, by International Monetary Fund staff, which analyzes the global economy in the near and medium term.\\n\\n\\n=== Conditionality of loans ===\\nIMF conditionality is a set of policies or conditions that the IMF requires in exchange for financial resources. The IMF does require collateral from countries for loans but also requires the government seeking assistance to correct its macroeconomic imbalances in the form of policy reform. If the conditions are not met, the funds are withheld. The concept of conditionality was introduced in a 1952 executive board decision and later incorporated into the Articles of Agreement.\\nConditionality is associated with economic theory as well as an enforcement mechanism for repayment. Stemming primarily from the work of Jacques Polak, the theoretical underpinning of conditionality was the \"monetary approach to the balance of payments\".\\n\\n\\n==== Structural adjustment ====\\n\\nSome of the conditions for structural adjustment can include:\\n\\nCutting expenditures or raising revenues, also known as austerity.\\nFocusing economic output on direct export and resource extraction,\\nDevaluation of currencies,\\nTrade liberalisation, or lifting import and export restrictions,\\nIncreasing the stability of investment (by supplementing foreign direct investment with the opening of facilities for the domestic market),\\nBalancing budgets and not overspending,\\nRemoving price controls and state subsidies,\\nPrivatization, or divestiture of all or part of state-owned enterprises,\\nEnhancing the rights of foreign investors vis-a-vis national laws,\\nImproving governance and fighting corruption,These conditions are known as the Washington Consensus.\\n\\n\\n==== Benefits ====\\nThese loan conditions ensure that the borrowing country will be able to repay the IMF and that the country will not attempt to solve their balance-of-payment problems in a way that would negatively impact the international economy. The incentive problem of moral hazard—when economic agents maximise their own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.Conditionality also reassures the IMF that the funds lent to them will be used for the purposes defined by the Articles of Agreement and provides safeguards that the country will be able to rectify its macroeconomic and structural imbalances. In the judgment of the IMF, the adoption by the member of certain corrective measures or policies will allow it to repay the IMF, thereby ensuring that the resources will be available to support other members.As of 2004, borrowing countries have had a good track record for repaying credit extended under the IMF\\'s regular lending facilities with full interest over the duration of the loan. This indicates that IMF lending does not impose a burden on creditor countries, as lending countries receive market-rate interest on most of their quota subscription, plus any of their own-currency subscriptions that are loaned out by the IMF, plus all of the reserve assets that they provide the IMF.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 20th century ===\\nThe IMF was originally laid out as a part of the Bretton Woods system exchange agreement in 1944. During the Great Depression, countries sharply raised barriers to trade in an attempt to improve their failing economies. This led to the devaluation of national currencies and a decline in world trade.This breakdown in international monetary cooperation created a need for oversight. The representatives of 45 governments met at the Bretton Woods Conference in the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in the United States, to discuss a framework for postwar international economic cooperation and how to rebuild Europe.\\nThere were two views on the role the IMF should assume as a global economic institution. American delegate Harry Dexter White foresaw an IMF that functioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay their debts on time. Most of White\\'s plan was incorporated into the final acts adopted at Bretton Woods. British economist John Maynard Keynes, on the other hand, imagined that the IMF would be a cooperative fund upon which member states could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through periodic crises. This view suggested an IMF that helped governments and act as the United States government had during the New Deal to the great depression of the 1930s.The IMF formally came into existence on 27 December 1945, when the first 29 countries ratified its Articles of Agreement. By the end of 1946 the IMF had grown to 39 members. On 1 March 1947, the IMF began its financial operations, and on 8 May France became the first country to borrow from it.The IMF was one of the key organizations of the international economic system; its design allowed the system to balance the rebuilding of international capitalism with the maximization of national economic sovereignty and human welfare, also known as embedded liberalism. The IMF\\'s influence in the global economy steadily increased as it accumulated more members. Its membership began to expand in the late 1950s and during the 1960s as many African countries became independent and applied for membership. But the Cold War limited the Fund\\'s membership, with most countries in the Soviet sphere of influence not joining until 1970s and 1980s.The Bretton Woods exchange rate system prevailed until 1971 when the United States government suspended the convertibility of the US$ (and dollar reserves held by other governments) into gold. This is known as the Nixon Shock. The changes to the IMF articles of agreement reflecting these changes were ratified in 1976 by the Jamaica Accords. Later in the 1970s, large commercial banks began lending to states because they were awash in cash deposited by oil exporters. The lending of the so-called money center banks led to the IMF changing its role in the 1980s after a world recession provoked a crisis that brought the IMF back into global financial governance.In the mid-1980s, the IMF shifted its narrow focus from currency stabilization to a broader focus of promoting market-liberalizing reforms through structural adjustment programs. This shift occurred without a formal renegotiation of the organization\\'s charter or operational guidelines. The Ronald Reagan administration, in particular Treasury Secretary James Baker, his assistant secretary David Mulford and deputy assistant secretary Charles Dallara, pressured the IMF to attach market-liberal reforms to the organization\\'s conditional loans.During the 20th century, the IMF shifted its position on capital controls. Whereas the IMF permitted capital controls at its founding and throughout the 1970s, IMF staff increasingly favored free capital movement from 1980s onwards. This shift happened in the aftermath of an emerging consensus in economics on the desirability of free capital movement, retirement of IMF staff hired in the 1940s and 1950s, and the recruitment of staff exposed to new thinking in economics.\\n\\n\\n=== 21st century ===\\nThe IMF provided two major lending packages in the early 2000s to Argentina (during the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression) and Uruguay (after the 2002 Uruguay banking crisis). However, by the mid-2000s, IMF lending was at its lowest share of world GDP since the 1970s.In May 2010, the IMF participated, in 3:11 proportion, in the first Greek bailout that totaled €110 billion, to address the great accumulation of public debt, caused by continuing large public sector deficits. As part of the bailout, the Greek government agreed to adopt austerity measures that would reduce the deficit from 11% in 2009 to \"well below 3%\" in 2014. The bailout did not include debt restructuring measures such as a haircut, to the chagrin of the Swiss, Brazilian, Indian, Russian, and Argentinian Directors of the IMF, with the Greek authorities themselves (at the time, PM George Papandreou and Finance Minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou) ruling out a haircut.A second bailout package of more than €100 billion was agreed upon over the course of a few months from October 2011, during which time Papandreou was forced from office. The so-called Troika, of which the IMF is part, are joint managers of this programme, which was approved by the executive directors of the IMF on 15 March 2012 for XDR 23.8 billion and saw private bondholders take a haircut of upwards of 50%. In the interval between May 2010 and February 2012 the private banks of Holland, France, and Germany reduced exposure to Greek debt from €122 billion to €66 billion.As of January 2012, the largest borrowers from the IMF in order were Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Romania, and Ukraine.On 25 March 2013, a €10 billion international bailout of Cyprus was agreed by the Troika, at the cost to the Cypriots of its agreement: to close the country\\'s second-largest bank; to impose a one-time bank deposit levy on Bank of Cyprus uninsured deposits. No insured deposit of €100k or less were to be affected under the terms of a novel bail-in scheme.The topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by the IMF in April 2013, for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund\\'s Legal and Policy Framework\". The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May, summarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and Jamaica. An explanatory interview with deputy director Hugh Bredenkamp was published a few days later, as was a deconstruction by Matina Stevis of The Wall Street Journal.In the October 2013, Fiscal Monitor publication, the IMF suggested that a capital levy capable of reducing Euro-area government debt ratios to \"end-2007 levels\" would require a very high tax rate of about 10%.The Fiscal Affairs department of the IMF, headed at the time by Acting Director Sanjeev Gupta, produced a January 2014 report entitled \"Fiscal Policy and Income Inequality\" that stated that \"Some taxes levied on wealth, especially on immovable property, are also an option for economies seeking more progressive taxation ... Property taxes are equitable and efficient, but underutilized in many economies ... There is considerable scope to exploit this tax more fully, both as a revenue source and as a redistributive instrument.\"At the end of March 2014, the IMF secured an $18 billion bailout fund for the provisional government of Ukraine in the aftermath of the Revolution of Dignity.\\n\\n\\n==== Response and analysis of coronavirus ====\\nIn late 2019, the IMF estimated global growth in 2020 to reach 3.4%, but due to the coronavirus, in November 2020, it expected the global economy to shrink by 4.4%.In March 2020, Kristalina Georgieva announced that the IMF stood ready to mobilize $1 trillion as its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was in addition to the $50 billion fund it had announced two weeks earlier, of which $5 billion had already been requested by Iran. One day earlier on 11 March, the UK called to pledge £150 million to the IMF catastrophe relief fund. It came to light on 27 March that \"more than 80 poor and middle-income countries\" had sought a bailout due to the coronavirus.On 13 April 2020, the IMF said that it \"would provide immediate debt relief to 25 member countries under its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT)\" programme.\\n\\n\\n== Member countries ==\\nNot all member countries of the IMF are sovereign states, and therefore not all \"member countries\" of the IMF are members of the United Nations. Amidst \"member countries\" of the IMF that are not member states of the UN are non-sovereign areas with special jurisdictions that are officially under the sovereignty of full UN member states, such as Aruba, Curaçao, Hong Kong, and Macao, as well as Kosovo. The corporate members appoint ex-officio voting members, who are listed below. All members of the IMF are also International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) members and vice versa.Former members are Cuba (which left in 1964), and Taiwan, which was ejected from the IMF in 1980 after losing the support of the then United States President Jimmy Carter and was replaced by the People\\'s Republic of China. However, \"Taiwan Province of China\" is still listed in the official IMF indices.Apart from Cuba, the other UN states that do not belong to the IMF are Liechtenstein, Monaco and North Korea. However, Andorra became the 190th member on 16 October 2020.Poland withdrew in 1950—allegedly pressured by the Soviet Union—but returned in 1986. The former Czechoslovakia was expelled in 1954 for \"failing to provide required data\" and was readmitted in 1990, after the Velvet Revolution.\\n\\n\\n=== Qualifications ===\\nAny country may apply to be a part of the IMF. Post-IMF formation, in the early postwar period, rules for IMF membership were left relatively loose. Members needed to make periodic membership payments towards their quota, to refrain from currency restrictions unless granted IMF permission, to abide by the Code of Conduct in the IMF Articles of Agreement, and to provide national economic information. However, stricter rules were imposed on governments that applied to the IMF for funding.The countries that joined the IMF between 1945 and 1971 agreed to keep their exchange rates secured at rates that could be adjusted only to correct a \"fundamental disequilibrium\" in the balance of payments, and only with the IMF\\'s agreement.\\n\\n\\n=== Benefits ===\\nMember countries of the IMF have access to information on the economic policies of all member countries, the opportunity to influence other members\\' economic policies, technical assistance in banking, fiscal affairs, and exchange matters, financial support in times of payment difficulties, and increased opportunities for trade and investment.\\n\\n\\n== Personnel ==\\n\\n\\n=== Board of Governors ===\\nThe board of governors consists of one governor and one alternate governor for each member country. Each member country appoints its two governors. The Board normally meets once a year and is responsible for electing or appointing an executive director to the executive board. While the board of governors is officially responsible for approving quota increases, special drawing right allocations, the admittance of new members, compulsory withdrawal of members, and amendments to the Articles of Agreement and By-Laws, in practice it has delegated most of its powers to the IMF\\'s executive board.The board of governors is advised by the International Monetary and Financial Committee and the Development Committee. The International Monetary and Financial Committee has 24 members and monitors developments in global liquidity and the transfer of resources to developing countries. The Development Committee has 25 members and advises on critical development issues and on financial resources required to promote economic development in developing countries.\\nThe board of governors reports directly to the managing director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva.\\n\\n\\n=== Executive Board ===\\n24 Executive Directors make up the executive board. The executive directors represent all 189 member countries in a geographically based roster. Countries with large economies have their own executive director, but most countries are grouped in constituencies representing four or more countries.Following the 2008 Amendment on Voice and Participation which came into effect in March 2011, seven countries each appoint an executive director: the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia. The remaining 17 Directors represent constituencies consisting of 2 to 23 countries. This Board usually meets several times each week. The board membership and constituency is scheduled for periodic review every eight years.\\n\\n\\n=== Managing Director ===\\nThe IMF is led by a managing director, who is head of the staff and serves as chairman of the executive board. The managing director is the most powerful position at the IMF. Historically, the IMF\\'s managing director has been a European citizen and the president of the World Bank has been an American citizen. However, this standard is increasingly being questioned and competition for these two posts may soon open up to include other qualified candidates from any part of the world. In August 2019, the International Monetary Fund has removed the age limit which is 65 or over for its managing director position.In 2011, the world\\'s largest developing countries, the BRIC states, issued a statement declaring that the tradition of appointing a European as managing director undermined the legitimacy of the IMF and called for the appointment to be merit-based.\\n\\n\\n==== List of Managing Directors ====\\nFormer managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested in connection with charges of sexually assaulting a New York hotel room attendant and resigned on 18 May. The charges were later dropped. On 28 June 2011 Christine Lagarde was confirmed as managing director of the IMF for a five-year term starting on 5 July 2011. She was re-elected by consensus for a second five-year term, starting 5 July 2016, being the only candidate nominated for the post of managing director.\\n\\n\\n=== First Deputy Managing Director ===\\nThe managing director is assisted by a First Deputy managing director (FDMD) who, by convention, has always been a citizen of the United States. Together, the managing director and their First Deputy lead the senior management of the IMF. Like the managing director, the First Deputy traditionally serves a five-year term.\\n\\n\\n==== List of First Deputy Managing Directors ====\\n\\n\\n=== Chief Economist ===\\n\\nThe chief economist leads the research division of the IMF and is a \"senior official\" of the IMF.\\n\\n\\n==== List of Chief Economists ====\\n\\n\\n=== IMF staff ===\\nIMF staff have considerable autonomy and are known to shape IMF policy. According to Jeffrey Chwieroth, \"It is the staff members who conduct the bulk of the IMF\\'s tasks; they formulate policy proposals for consideration by member states, exercise surveillance, carry out loan negotiations and design the programs, and collect and systematize detailed information.\" Most IMF staff are economists. According to a 1968 study, nearly 60% of staff were from English-speaking developed countries. By 2004, between 40 and 50% of staff were from English-speaking developed countries.A 1996 study found that 90% of new staff with a PhD obtained them from universities in the United States or Canada. A 1999 study found that none of the new staff with a PhD obtained their PhD in the Global South.\\n\\n\\n== Voting power ==\\nVoting power in the IMF is based on a quota system. Each member has a number of basic votes, equal to 5.502% of the total votes, plus one additional vote for each special drawing right (SDR) of 100,000 of a member country\\'s quota. The SDR is the unit of account of the IMF and represents a potential claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias. Changes in the voting shares require approval by a super-majority of 85% of voting power.\\nIn December 2015, the United States Congress adopted a legislation authorising the 2010 Quota and Governance Reforms. As a result,\\n\\nall 190 members\\' quotas will increase from a total of about XDR 238.5 billion to about XDR 477 billion, while the quota shares and voting power of the IMF\\'s poorest member countries will be protected.\\nmore than 6 percent of quota shares will shift to dynamic emerging market and developing countries and also from over-represented to under-represented members.\\nfour emerging market countries (Brazil, China, India, and Russia) will be among the ten largest members of the IMF. Other top 10 members are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy.\\n\\n\\n=== Effects of the quota system ===\\nThe IMF\\'s quota system was created to raise funds for loans. Each IMF member country is assigned a quota, or contribution, that reflects the country\\'s relative size in the global economy. Each member\\'s quota also determines its relative voting power. Thus, financial contributions from member governments are linked to voting power in the organization.This system follows the logic of a shareholder-controlled organization: wealthy countries have more say in the making and revision of rules. Since decision making at the IMF reflects each member\\'s relative economic position in the world, wealthier countries that provide more money to the IMF have more influence than poorer members that contribute less; nonetheless, the IMF focuses on redistribution.\\n\\n\\n=== Inflexibility of voting power ===\\nQuotas are normally reviewed every five years and can be increased when deemed necessary by the board of governors. IMF voting shares are relatively inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-represented as their voting power lags behind. Currently, reforming the representation of developing countries within the IMF has been suggested. These countries\\' economies represent a large portion of the global economic system but this is not reflected in the IMF\\'s decision-making process through the nature of the quota system. Joseph Stiglitz argues, \"There is a need to provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries, which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since 1944, when the IMF was created.\" In 2008, a number of quota reforms were passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.\\n\\n\\n=== Overcoming borrower/creditor divide ===\\nThe IMF\\'s membership is divided along income lines: certain countries provide financial resources while others use these resources. Both developed country \"creditors\" and developing country \"borrowers\" are members of the IMF. The developed countries provide the financial resources but rarely enter into IMF loan agreements; they are the creditors. Conversely, the developing countries use the lending services but contribute little to the pool of money available to lend because their quotas are smaller; they are the borrowers. Thus, tension is created around governance issues because these two groups, creditors and borrowers, have fundamentally different interests.The criticism is that the system of voting power distribution through a quota system institutionalizes borrower subordination and creditor dominance. The resulting division of the IMF\\'s membership into borrowers and non-borrowers has increased the controversy around conditionality because the borrowers are interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain reassurance that the loans will be repaid.\\n\\n\\n== Use ==\\nA recent source revealed that the average overall use of IMF credit per decade increased, in real terms, by 21% between the 1970s and 1980s, and increased again by just over 22% from the 1980s to the 1991–2005 period. Another study has suggested that since 1950 the continent of Africa alone has received $300 billion from the IMF, the World Bank, and affiliate institutions.A study by Bumba Mukherjee found that developing democratic countries benefit more from IMF programs than developing autocratic countries because policy-making, and the process of deciding where loaned money is used, is more transparent within a democracy. One study done by Randall Stone found that although earlier studies found little impact of IMF programs on balance of payments, more recent studies using more sophisticated methods and larger samples \"usually found IMF programs improved the balance of payments\".\\n\\n\\n=== Exceptional Access Framework – sovereign debt ===\\nThe Exceptional Access Framework was created in 2003 when John B. Taylor was Under Secretary of the US Treasury for International Affairs. The new Framework became fully operational in February 2003 and it was applied in the subsequent decisions on Argentina and Brazil. Its purpose was to place some sensible rules and limits on the way the IMF makes loans to support governments with debt problem—especially in emerging markets—and thereby move away from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. Such a reform was essential for ending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets. The reform was closely related to and put in place nearly simultaneously with the actions of several emerging market countries to place collective action clauses in their bond contracts.\\nIn 2010, the framework was abandoned so the IMF could make loans to Greece in an unsustainable and political situation.The topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by IMF staff in April 2013 for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund\\'s Legal and Policy Framework\". The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May, summarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and Jamaica. An explanatory interview with deputy director Hugh Bredenkamp was published a few days later, as was a deconstruction by Matina Stevis of The Wall Street Journal.The staff was directed to formulate an updated policy, which was accomplished on 22 May 2014 with a report entitled \"The Fund\\'s Lending Framework and Sovereign Debt: Preliminary Considerations\", and taken up by the executive board on 13 June. The staff proposed that \"in circumstances where a (Sovereign) member has lost market access and debt is considered sustainable ... the IMF would be able to provide Exceptional Access on the basis of a debt operation that involves an extension of maturities\", which was labeled a \"reprofiling operation\". These reprofiling operations would \"generally be less costly to the debtor and creditors—and thus to the system overall—relative to either an upfront debt reduction operation or a bail-out that is followed by debt reduction ... (and) would be envisaged only when both (a) a member has lost market access and (b) debt is assessed to be sustainable, but not with high probability ... Creditors will only agree if they understand that such an amendment is necessary to avoid a worse outcome: namely, a default and/or an operation involving debt reduction ... Collective action clauses, which now exist in most—but not all—bonds would be relied upon to address collective action problems.\"\\n\\n\\n== Impact ==\\nAccording to a 2002 study by Randall W. Stone, the academic literature on the IMF shows \"no consensus on the long-term effects of IMF programs on growth\".Some research has found that IMF loans can reduce the chance of a future banking crisis, while other studies have found that they can increase the risk of political crises. IMF programs can reduce the effects of a currency crisis.Some research has found that IMF programs are less effective in countries which possess a developed-country patron (be it by foreign aid, membership of postcolonial institutions or UN voting patterns), seemingly due to this patron allowing countries to flaunt IMF program rules as these rules are not consistently enforced. Some research has found that IMF loans reduce economic growth due to creating an economic moral hazard, reducing public investment, reducing incentives to create a robust domestic policies and reducing private investor confidence. Other research has indicated that IMF loans can have a positive impact on economic growth and that their effects are highly nuanced.\\n\\n\\n== Criticisms ==\\nOverseas Development Institute (ODI) research undertaken in 1980 included criticisms of the IMF which support the analysis that it is a pillar of what activist Titus Alexander calls global apartheid.\\nDeveloped countries were seen to have a more dominant role and control over less developed countries (LDCs).\\nThe Fund worked on the incorrect assumption that all payments disequilibria were caused domestically. The Group of 24 (G-24), on behalf of LDC members, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) complained that the IMF did not distinguish sufficiently between disequilibria with predominantly external as opposed to internal causes. This criticism was voiced in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. Then LDCs found themselves with payment deficits due to adverse changes in their terms of trade, with the Fund prescribing stabilization programmes similar to those suggested for deficits caused by government over-spending. Faced with long-term, externally generated disequilibria, the G-24 argued for more time for LDCs to adjust their economies.\\nSome IMF policies may be anti-developmental; the report said that deflationary effects of IMF programmes quickly led to losses of output and employment in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high. Moreover, the burden of the deflation is disproportionately borne by the poor.\\nThe IMF\\'s initial policies were based in theory and influenced by differing opinions and departmental rivalries. Critics suggest that its intentions to implement these policies in countries with widely varying economic circumstances were misinformed and lacked economic rationale.ODI conclusions were that the IMF\\'s very nature of promoting market-oriented approaches attracted unavoidable criticism. On the other hand, the IMF could serve as a scapegoat while allowing governments to blame international bankers. The ODI conceded that the IMF was insensitive to political aspirations of LDCs while its policy conditions were inflexible.Argentina, which had been considered by the IMF to be a model country in its compliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to have been caused by IMF-induced budget restrictions—which undercut the government\\'s ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health, education, and security—and privatisation of strategically vital national resources. Others attribute the crisis to Argentina\\'s misdesigned fiscal federalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly. The crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region\\'s economic problems. The current—as of early 2006—trend toward moderate left-wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic policy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this crisis.In 2006, a senior ActionAid policy analyst Akanksha Marphatia stated that IMF policies in Africa undermine any possibility of meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) due to imposed restrictions that prevent spending on important sectors, such as education and health.In an interview (2008-05-19), the former Romanian Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu claimed that \"Since 2005, IMF is constantly making mistakes when it appreciates the country\\'s economic performances\". Former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who claimed that debt-ridden African states were ceding sovereignty to the IMF and the World Bank, famously asked, \"Who elected the IMF to be the ministry of finance for every country in the world?\"Former chief economist of IMF and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan who predicted the financial crisis of 2007–08 criticised the IMF for remaining a sideline player to the developed world. He criticised the IMF for praising the monetary policies of the US, which he believed were wreaking havoc in emerging markets. He had been critical of \"ultra-loose money policies\" of some unnamed countries.Countries such as Zambia have not received proper aid with long-lasting effects, leading to concern from economists. Since 2005, Zambia (as well as 29 other African countries) did receive debt write-offs, which helped with the country\\'s medical and education funds. However, Zambia returned to a debt of over half its GDP in less than a decade. American economist William Easterly, sceptical of the IMF\\'s methods, had initially warned that \"debt relief would simply encourage more reckless borrowing by crooked governments unless it was accompanied by reforms to speed up economic growth and improve governance\", according to The Economist.\\n\\n\\n=== Conditionality ===\\n\\nThe IMF has been criticised for being \"out of touch\" with local economic conditions, cultures, and environments in the countries they are requiring policy reform. The economic advice the IMF gives might not always take into consideration the difference between what spending means on paper and how it is felt by citizens. Countries charge that with excessive conditionality, they do not \"own\" the programmes and the links are broken between a recipient country\\'s people, its government, and the goals being pursued by the IMF.Jeffrey Sachs argues that the IMF\\'s \"usual prescription is \\'budgetary belt tightening to countries who are much too poor to own belts\\'\". Sachs wrote that the IMF\\'s role as a generalist institution specialising in macroeconomic issues needs reform. Conditionality has also been criticised because a country can pledge collateral of \"acceptable assets\" to obtain waivers—if one assumes that all countries are able to provide \"acceptable collateral\".One view is that conditionality undermines domestic political institutions. The recipient governments are sacrificing policy autonomy in exchange for funds, which can lead to public resentment of the local leadership for accepting and enforcing the IMF conditions. Political instability can result from more leadership turnover as political leaders are replaced in electoral backlashes. IMF conditions are often criticised for reducing government services, thus increasing unemployment.Another criticism is that IMF policies are only designed to address poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, and too much state ownership. This assumes that this narrow range of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored. A country may also be compelled to accept conditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial crisis in need of assistance.On top of that, regardless of what methodologies and data sets used, it comes to same the conclusion of exacerbating income inequality. With Gini coefficient, it became clear that countries with IMF policies face increased income inequality.It is claimed that conditionalities retard social stability and hence inhibit the stated goals of the IMF, while Structural Adjustment Programmes lead to an increase in poverty in recipient countries. The IMF sometimes advocates \"austerity programmes\", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when the economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing budget deficits. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax rate. In Globalization and Its Discontents, Joseph E. Stiglitz, former chief economist and senior vice-president at the World Bank, criticises these policies. He argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out Keynesian reflations, and that the IMF \"was not participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the Western financial community.\"Stiglitz concludes, \"Modern high-tech warfare is designed to remove physical contact: dropping bombs from 50,000 feet ensures that one does not \\'feel\\' what one does. Modern economic management is similar: from one\\'s luxury hotel, one can callously impose policies about which one would think twice if one knew the people whose lives one was destroying.\"The researchers Eric Toussaint and Damien Millet argue that the IMF\\'s policies amount to a new form of colonisation that does not need a military presence: \\n\\nFollowing the exigencies of the governments of the richest companies, the IMF, permitted countries in crisis to borrow in order to avoid default on their repayments. Caught in the debt\\'s downward spiral, developing countries soon had no other recourse than to take on new debt in order to repay the old debt. Before providing them with new loans, at higher interest rates, future leaders asked the IMF, to intervene with the guarantee of ulterior reimbursement, asking for a signed agreement with the said countries. The IMF  thus agreed to restart the flow of the \\'finance pump\\' on condition that the concerned countries first use this money to reimburse banks and other private lenders, while restructuring their economy at the IMF\\'s discretion: these were the famous conditionalities, detailed in the Structural Adjustment Programmes. The IMF and its ultra-liberal experts took control of the borrowing countries\\' economic policies. A new form of colonisation was thus instituted. It was not even necessary to establish an administrative or military presence; the debt alone maintained this new form of submission.\\nInternational politics play an important role in IMF decision making. The clout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to IMF finances. The United States has the greatest number of votes and therefore wields the most influence. Domestic politics often come into play, with politicians in developing countries using conditionality to gain leverage over the opposition to influence policy.In 2016, the IMF\\'s research department published a report titled \"Neoliberalism: Oversold?\" which, while praising some aspects of the \"neoliberal agenda\", claims that the organisation has been \"overselling\" fiscal austerity policies and financial deregulation, which they claim has exacerbated both financial crises and economic inequality around the world.In 2020 and 2021, Oxfam criticized the IMF for forcing tough austerity measures on many low income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite forcing cuts to healthcare spending, would hamper the recipient\\'s response to the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n=== Support of dictatorships ===\\nThe role of the Bretton Woods institutions has been controversial since the late Cold War, because of claims that the IMF policy makers supported military dictatorships friendly to American and European corporations, but also other anti-communist and Communist regimes (such as Mobutu\\'s Zaire and Ceaușescu\\'s Romania, respectively). Critics also claim that the IMF is generally apathetic or hostile to human rights, and labour rights. The controversy has helped spark the anti-globalization movement.\\nAn example of IMF\\'s support for a dictatorship was its ongoing support for Mobutu\\'s rule in Zaire, although its own envoy, Erwin Blumenthal, provided a sobering report about the entrenched corruption and embezzlement and the inability of the country to pay back any loans.Arguments in favour of the IMF say that economic stability is a precursor to democracy; however, critics highlight various examples in which democratised countries fell after receiving IMF loans.A 2017 study found no evidence of IMF lending programs undermining democracy in borrowing countries. To the contrary, it found \"evidence for modest but definitively positive conditional differences in the democracy scores of participating and non-participating countries\".On 28 June 2021, the IMF approved a US$1 billion loan to the Ugandan government despite protests from Ugandans in Washington, London and South Africa.\\n\\n\\n=== Impact on access to food ===\\nA number of civil society organisations have criticised the IMF\\'s policies for their impact on access to food, particularly in developing countries. In October 2008, former United States president Bill Clinton delivered a speech to the United Nations on World Food Day, criticising the World Bank and IMF for their policies on food and agriculture:\\n\\nWe need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including me when I was president. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, and we all have to go back to a more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture. \\nThe FPIF remarked that there is a recurring pattern: \"the destabilization of peasant producers by a one-two punch of IMF-World Bank structural adjustment programs that gutted government investment in the countryside followed by the massive influx of subsidized U.S. and European Union agricultural imports after the WTO\\'s Agreement on Agriculture pried open markets.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Impact on public health ===\\nA 2009 study concluded that the strict conditions resulted in thousands of deaths in Eastern Europe by tuberculosis as public health care had to be weakened. In the 21 countries to which the IMF had given loans, tuberculosis deaths rose by 16.6%. A 2017 systematic review on studies conducted on the impact that Structural adjustment programs have on child and maternal health found that these programs have a detrimental effect on maternal and child health among other adverse effects.\\n\\n\\n=== Reform ===\\n\\n\\n==== Function and policies ====\\nThe IMF is only one of many international organisations, and it is a generalist institution that deals only with macroeconomic issues; its core areas of concern in developing countries are very narrow. One proposed reform is a movement towards close partnership with other specialist agencies such as UNICEF, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).Jeffrey Sachs argues in The End of Poverty that the IMF and the World Bank have \"the brightest economists and the lead in advising poor countries on how to break out of poverty, but the problem is development economics\". Development economics needs the reform, not the IMF. He also notes that IMF loan conditions should be paired with other reforms—e.g., trade reform in developed nations, debt cancellation, and increased financial assistance for investments in basic infrastructure. IMF loan conditions cannot stand alone and produce change; they need to be partnered with other reforms or other conditions as applicable.\\n\\n\\n==== U.S. influence and voting reform ====\\nThe scholarly consensus is that IMF decision-making is not simply technocratic, but also guided by political and economic concerns. The United States is the IMF\\'s most powerful member, and its influence reaches even into decision-making concerning individual loan agreements. The U.S. has historically been openly opposed to losing what Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew described in 2015 as its \"leadership role\" at the IMF, and the U.S.\\' \"ability to shape international norms and practices\".Emerging markets were not well-represented for most of the IMF\\'s history: Despite being the most populous country, China\\'s vote share was the sixth largest; Brazil\\'s vote share was smaller than Belgium\\'s. Reforms to give more powers to emerging economies were agreed by the G20 in 2010. The reforms could not pass, however, until they were ratified by the United States Congress, since 85% of the Fund\\'s voting power was required for the reforms to take effect, and the Americans held more than 16% of voting power at the time. After repeated criticism, the U.S. finally ratified the voting reforms at the end of 2015. The OECD countries maintained their overwhelming majority of voting share, and the U.S. in particular retained its share at over 16%.The criticism of the American- and European-dominated IMF has led to what some consider \"disenfranchising the world\" from the governance of the IMF. Raúl Prebisch, the founding secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), wrote that one of \"the conspicuous deficiencies of the general economic theory, from the point of view of the periphery, is its false sense of universality\".\\n\\n\\n== IMF and globalization ==\\nGlobalization encompasses three institutions: global financial markets and transnational companies, national governments linked to each other in economic and military alliances led by the United States, and rising \"global governments\" such as World Trade Organization (WTO), IMF, and World Bank. Charles Derber argues in his book People Before Profit, \"These interacting institutions create a new global power system where sovereignty is globalized, taking power and constitutional authority away from nations and giving it to global markets and international bodies\". Titus Alexander argues that this system institutionalises global inequality between western countries and the Majority World in a form of global apartheid, in which the IMF is a key pillar.The establishment of globalised economic institutions has been both a symptom of and a stimulus for globalisation. The development of the World Bank, the IMF, regional development banks such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and multilateral trade institutions such as the WTO signals a move away from the dominance of the state as the primary actor analysed in international affairs. Globalization has thus been transformative in terms of limiting of state sovereignty over the economy.\\n\\n\\n=== International central bank digital currency ===\\nIn April 2023, the IMF launched their international central bank digital currency through their Digital Currency Monetary Authority, it will be called the Universal Monetary Unit, or Units for shorthand. The ANSI character will be Ü and will be used to facilitate international banking and international trade between countries and currencies. It will help facilitate SWIFT transactions on cross border transactions at wholesale FX rates instantaneously with real-time settlements. In June, it announced it was working on a platform for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that would enable transctions between nations. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said that if central banks did not agree on a common platform, cryptocurrencies would fill the resulting vacuum.\\n\\n\\n== Scandals ==\\nManaging Director Lagarde (2011–2019) was convicted of giving preferential treatment to businessman-turned-politician Bernard Tapie as he pursued a legal challenge against the French government. At the time, Lagarde was the French economic minister. Within hours of her conviction, in which she escaped any punishment, the fund\\'s 24-member executive board put to rest any speculation that she might have to resign, praising her \"outstanding leadership\" and the \"wide respect\" she commands around the world.Former IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato was arrested in 2015 for alleged fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. In 2017, the Audiencia Nacional found Rato guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to 4+1⁄2 years\\' imprisonment. In 2018, the sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Spain.\\n\\n\\n== Alternatives ==\\nIn March 2011, the Ministers of Economy and Finance of the African Union proposed to establish an African Monetary Fund.At the 6th BRICS summit in July 2014 the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) announced the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) with an initial size of US$100 billion, a framework to provide liquidity through currency swaps in response to actual or potential short-term balance-of-payments pressures.In 2014, the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was established.\\n\\n\\n== In the media ==\\nLife and Debt, a documentary film, deals with the IMF\\'s policies\\' influence on Jamaica and its economy from a critical point of view. Debtocracy, a 2011 independent Greek documentary film, also criticises the IMF. Portuguese musician José Mário Branco\\'s 1982 album FMI is inspired by the IMF\\'s intervention in Portugal through monitored stabilisation programs in 1977–78. In the 2015 film Our Brand Is Crisis, the IMF is mentioned as a point of political contention, where the Bolivian population fears its electoral interference.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Footnotes ===\\n\\n\\n=== Bibliography ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBordo, M.D. (1993).

       " 'Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team\\'s players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"runs\". The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners\\' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).\\nThe principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter\\'s reach. Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates\\' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.\\nThe opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team\\'s turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.\\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. Baseball\\'s American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of \"America\\'s Pastime\"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football. In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\\nIn Major League Baseball (MLB), the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League. The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world. Baseball was played at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated in 2020.\\n\\n\\n== Rules and gameplay ==\\n\\nA baseball game is played between two teams, each usually composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college, Minor League Baseball and, since the 2020 season, Major League Baseball; and six innings at the Little League level). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, counterclockwise, from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher\\'s mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball\\'s field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.There are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt:\\n\\nThe baseball is about the size of an adult\\'s fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.\\nThe bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (110 centimeters).\\nThe glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher\\'s mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.\\nPlay starts with a member of the batting team, the batter, standing in either of the two batter\\'s boxes next to home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or if the batter-runner otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. The ultimate and most desirable result possible for a batter would be to hit a home run while all three bases are occupied or \"loaded\", thus scoring four runs on a single hit. This is called a grand slam. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play, as only one runner may occupy a base at any given time. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter\\'s body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire\\'s judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter\\'s shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee. Any pitch which does not pass through the strike zone is called a ball, unless the batter either swings and misses at the pitch, or hits the pitch into foul territory; an exception generally occurs if the ball is hit into foul territory when the batter already has two strikes, in which case neither a ball nor a strike is called.\\n\\nWhile the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the strikeout and flyout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the ground out, force out, and tag out. These occur either when a runner is forced to advance to a base, and a fielder with possession of the ball reaches that base before the runner does, or the runner is touched by the ball, held in a fielder\\'s hand, while not on a base. (The batter-runner is always forced to advance to first base, and any other runners must advance to the next base if a teammate is forced to advance to their base.) It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team\\'s dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.An individual player\\'s turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team\\'s third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter\\'s hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team\\'s next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player\\'s team have all taken their turn at bat in the batting order. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. Children\\'s games often have more lenient rules, such as Little League rules, which allow players to be substituted back into the same game.If the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.\\n\\n\\n== Personnel ==\\n\\n\\n=== Players ===\\n\\nThe number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play. A Major League Baseball (MLB) team has a roster of 26 players with specific roles. A typical roster features the following players:\\nEight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular basis\\nFive starting pitchers who constitute the team\\'s pitching rotation or starting rotation\\nSeven relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team\\'s bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)\\nOne backup, or substitute, catcher\\nFive backup infielders and backup outfielders, or players who can play multiple positions, known as utility players.Most baseball leagues worldwide have the DH rule, including MLB, Japan\\'s Pacific League, and Caribbean professional leagues, along with major American amateur organizations. The Central League in Japan does not have the rule and high-level minor league clubs connected to National League teams are not required to field a DH. In leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and two or three other reserve players.\\n\\n\\n=== Managers and coaches ===\\nThe manager, or head coach, oversees the team\\'s major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, who occupy designated coaches\\' boxes, just outside the foul lines. These coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team\\'s uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.\\n\\n\\n=== Umpires ===\\nAny baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.\\n\\n\\n== Strategy ==\\n\\nMany of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team\\'s roster. During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions. The manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups and the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder (known as a defensive substitution).\\n\\n\\n== Tactics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pitching and fielding ===\\n\\nThe tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter, thus creating differing pitches that can be selected. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch.\\nWith a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner\\'s lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher\\'s movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.\\n\\n\\n=== Batting and baserunning ===\\nSeveral basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed, with a skillful contact hitter, the runner takes off with the pitch, drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt, calls for the batter to focus on making soft contact with the ball, so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position as the batter is thrown out at first. A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit. A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. In order to increase the chance of advancing a batter to first base via a walk, the manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch. The batter\\'s potential reward of reaching base (via a walk) exceeds the disadvantage if the next pitch is a strike.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. Consensus once held that today\\'s baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland. American baseball historian David Block suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game\\'s most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and \"tut-ball\". The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. Block discovered that the first recorded game of \"Bass-Ball\" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player. This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants.By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. The first officially recorded baseball game in North America was played in Beachville, Ontario, Canada, on June 4, 1838. In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City\\'s Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules, which in turn were based on rules developed in 1837 by William R. Wheaton of the Gotham Club. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the \"New York Nine\" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century. By the time of the Civil War, baseball had begun to overtake its fellow bat-and-ball sport cricket in popularity within the United States, due in part to baseball being of a much shorter duration than the form of cricket played at the time, as well as the fact that troops during the Civil War did not need a specialized playing surface to play baseball, as they would have required for cricket.\\n\\n\\n=== In the United States ===\\n\\n\\n==== Establishment of professional leagues ====\\nIn the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area, and by 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the \"national pastime\" or \"national game\". A year later, the sport\\'s first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players, was formed. In 1867, it barred participation by African Americans. The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876. Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. The National League\\'s first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by then.The National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country\\'s minor professional leagues. The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall.  The Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series led to the formation of the office of the Commissioner of Baseball. The first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.\\n\\n\\n==== Rise of Ruth and racial integration ====\\nCompared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant. The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict new regulations governed the ball\\'s size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system. A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939, Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania.\\nA large number of minor league teams disbanded when World War II led to a player shortage. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League to help keep the game in the public eye. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred in 1945: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League\\'s Brooklyn Dodgers and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues\\' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers. Latin-American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars. Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.\\n\\n\\n==== Attendance records and the age of steroids ====\\nIn 1975, the union\\'s power—and players\\' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. Significant work stoppages occurred in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years. Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance. After play resumed in 1995, non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of MLB.In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB\\'s all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.\\n\\n\\n=== Around the world ===\\nWith the historic popular moniker as \"America\\'s national pastime\", baseball is well-established in several other countries as well. As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both Canada and the United States. While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League.\\nIn 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, Veracruz. The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition. The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938). The Japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.\\nAfter World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955). Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues.The English football club, Aston Villa, were the first British baseball champions winning the 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain. The 2020 National Champions were the London Mets. Other European countries have seen professional leagues; the most successful, other than the Dutch league, is the Italian league, founded in 1948. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC).  Women\\'s baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries.After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. While the sport\\'s lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was MLB\\'s reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season. MLB initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.\\n\\n\\n== Distinctive elements ==\\nBaseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock, play is less individual, and the variation between playing fields is not as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball\\'s distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.\\n\\n\\n=== No clock to kill ===\\nIn clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. Whereas, in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket, the possibility of a draw (which occurs because of the restrictions on time, which like in baseball, originally did not exist) often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play, with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade\\'s average of 3:18.In 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. This was up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014. In response to the lengthening of the game, MLB decided from the 2023 season onward to institute a pitch clock rule to penalize batters and pitchers who take too much time between pitches; this had the effect of shortening 2023 regular season games by 24 minutes on average.\\n\\n\\n=== Individual focus ===\\nAlthough baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. While rewarding, it has sometimes been described as \"ruthless\" due to the pressure on the individual player. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\". Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.\\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.\\n\\n\\n=== Uniqueness of parks ===\\n\\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and Minor League Baseball, is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 feet (99 m) from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 feet (122 m) to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 315 feet (96 m) from home plate. There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston\\'s Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is 310 feet (94 m) from home plate down the line and 37 feet (11 m) tall.Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use artificial turf. Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.\\nThese physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher\\'s park or a hitter\\'s park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude—5,282 feet (1,610 m) above sea level—is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter\\'s park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a pitcher\\'s park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing in, it becomes more of a hitter\\'s park when they are blowing out. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players\\' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball 330 feet (100 m) into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter\\'s park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.\\n\\n\\n== Statistics ==\\n\\nOrganized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\" The statistical record is so central to the game\\'s \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball. In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"The Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. General managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.\\n\\nCertain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics include:\\nAt bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter\\'s ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners\\nHits: times a base is reached safely, because of a batted, fair ball without a fielding error or fielder\\'s choice\\nRuns: times circling the bases and reaching home safely\\nRuns batted in (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter\\'s action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error\\nHome runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error\\nBatting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting abilityThe basic baserunning statistics include:\\nStolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner\\'s own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball\\nCaught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a baseThe basic pitching statistics include:\\nWins: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)\\nLosses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished\\nSaves: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher\\'s team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings\\nInnings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., \"5.2\" or \"7.1\", the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning)\\nStrikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter\\nWinning percentage: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)\\nEarned run average (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitchedThe basic fielding statistics include:\\nPutouts: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out\\nAssists: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball\\nErrors: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result\\nTotal chances: putouts plus assists plus errors\\nFielding average: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chancesAmong the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.\\n\\n\\n=== Sabermetrics ===\\nSabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field\\'s leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter\\'s skill than batting average:\\nOn-base percentage (OBP) measures a batter\\'s ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter\\'s successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter\\'s total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.\\nSlugging percentage (SLG) measures a batter\\'s ability to hit for power. It is calculated by taking the batter\\'s total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter\\'s at bats.Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:\\n\\nOn-base plus slugging (OPS) measures a batter\\'s overall ability. It is calculated by adding the batter\\'s on-base percentage and slugging percentage.\\nWalks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) measures a pitcher\\'s ability at preventing hitters from reaching base. It is calculated by adding the number of walks and hits a pitcher surrendered, then dividing by the number of innings pitched.\\nWins Above Replacement (WAR) measures number of additional wins his team has achieved above the number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a replacement-level player.\\n\\n\\n== Popularity and cultural impact ==\\nWriting in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as the national religion of the US. In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been \"a unique paragon of American culture\"—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal. Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes \"how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.\"\\n\\n\\n=== In the United States ===\\nThe major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League\\'s set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.\\nOverall, baseball has a large following in the United States; a 2006 poll found that nearly half of Americans are fans. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball\\'s position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 2008, MLB set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the NFL\\'s revenue for the first time in decades. A new MLB revenue record of more than $10 billion was set in 2017. On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 9%, compared to pro football at 37%. In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. Eight years later, it dropped under 73 million. Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella set a record in 2008, with 43.3 million. While MLB games have not drawn the same national TV viewership as football games, MLB games are dominant in teams\\' local markets and regularly lead all programs in primetime in their markets during the summer.\\n\\n\\n=== Caribbean ===\\nSince the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís, has been the major leagues\\' primary source of foreign talent. In 2017, 83 of the 868 players on MLB Opening Day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country. Among other Caribbean countries and territories, a combined 97 MLB players were born in Venezuela, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico\\'s history. While baseball has long been the island\\'s primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues\\' annual first-year player draft. In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues.\\n\\n\\n=== Asia ===\\nIn Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea. In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB\\'s growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. Revenue figures are not released for the country\\'s amateur system. Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport\\'s governing authority \"has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes\". In Taiwan, baseball is one of the most widely spectated sports, with the origins dating back to Japanese rule.\\n\\n\\n=== Among children ===\\nAs of 2018, Little League Baseball oversees leagues with close to 2.4 million participants in over 80 countries. The number of players has fallen since the 1990s, when 3 million children took part in Little League Baseball annually. Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants. According to the president of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the introductory game of Tee Ball.A varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2015, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 34,000 collegians played on their schools\\' baseball teams. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan\\'s leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.\\n\\n\\n=== In popular culture ===\\nBaseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City\\'s Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer\\'s poem \"Casey at the Bat\", appeared in 1888. A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a \"clutch situation\", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field of Dreams (1989). The American Film Institute\\'s selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5. Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J. Gaskin\\'s \"Slide, Kelly, Slide\", Simon and Garfunkel\\'s \"Mrs. Robinson\", and John Fogerty\\'s \"Centerfield\". The baseball-inspired comedic sketch \"Who\\'s on First?\", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud\\'s The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover\\'s The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., John Grisham\\'s Calico Joe and W. P. Kinsella\\'s Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams). Baseball\\'s literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter\\'s The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn\\'s The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis\\'s Moneyball. The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton\\'s tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.Modern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players\\' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.\\n\\n\\n=== Derivative games ===\\nInformal variations of baseball have popped up over time, with games like corkball reflecting local traditions and allowing the game to be played in diverse environments. Two variations of baseball, softball and Baseball5, are internationally governed alongside baseball by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.\\n\\n\\n==== British baseball ====\\n\\nAmerican professional baseball teams toured Britain in 1874 and 1889, and had a great effect on similar sports in Britain. In Wales and Merseyside, a strong community game had already developed with skills and plays more in keeping with the American game and the Welsh began to informally adopt the name \"baseball\" (Pêl Fas), to reflect the American style. By the 1890s, calls were made to follow the success of other working class sports (like Rugby in Wales and Soccer in Merseyside) and adopt a distinct set of rules and bureaucracy. During the 1892 season rules for the game of \"baseball\" were agreed and the game was officially codified.\\n\\n\\n==== Finnish baseball ====\\n\\nFinnish baseball, also known as pesäpallo, is a combination of traditional ball-batting team games and North American baseball, invented by Lauri \"Tahko\" Pihkala in the 1920s. The basic idea of pesäpallo is similar to that of baseball: the offense tries to score by hitting the ball successfully and running through the bases, while the defense tries to put the batter and runners out. One of the most important differences between pesäpallo and baseball is that the ball is pitched vertically, which makes hitting the ball, as well as controlling the power and direction of the hit, much easier. This gives the offensive game more variety, speed, and tactical aspects compared to baseball.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBaseball awards\\nBaseball clothing and equipment\\nList of baseball films\\nList of organized baseball leagues\\nWomen in baseball\\n\\n\\n=== Related sports ===\\nBrännboll (Scandinavian bat-and-ball game)\\nComparison of baseball and cricket\\nLapta (game) (Russian bat-and-ball game)\\nOină (Romanian bat-and-ball game)\\nSnow baseball (with similar rules played in India during winters)\\nStickball\\nStoop ball\\nVitilla\\nWiffle ball\\n\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n\\n\\n== General and cited sources ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nDickson, Paul.

       " 'Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.Swimming is a popular recreational activity and competitive sport that involves moving through water using various techniques. It offers numerous health benefits and is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.\\nSwimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.  As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.\\nSwimming involves repeated motions known as strokes in order to propel the body forward. While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest of the four main strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as training.\\nMainly because of the aquatic environment where it takes place, swimming comes with certain risks. By way of example, swimmers may find themselves incapacitated by panic and exhaustion, both potential causes of death by drowning. Other dangers may arise from exposure to infection or to hostile aquatic fauna. To minimize such eventualities, most facilities employ a lifeguard to keep alert for any signs of distress.\\nSwimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the culture of the area, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire. In addition to this, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels.\\n\\n\\n== Science ==\\nSwimming relies on the nearly neutral buoyancy of the human body. On average, the body has a relative density of 0.98 compared to water, which causes the body to float. However, buoyancy varies on the basis of body composition, lung inflation, muscle and fat content, centre of gravity and the salinity of the water. Higher levels of body fat and saltier water both lower the relative density of the body and increase its buoyancy. Human males tend to have a lower centre of gravity and higher muscle content, therefore find it more difficult to float or be buoyant.  See also: Hydrostatic weighing. \\nSince the human body is less dense than water, water is able to support the weight of the body during swimming. As a result, swimming is \"low-impact\" compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.\\nHydrodynamics is important to stroke technique for swimming faster, and swimmers who want to swim faster or exhaust less try to reduce the drag of the body\\'s motion through the water. To be more hydrodynamically effective, swimmers can either increase the power of their strokes or reduce water resistance, though power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance. Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.Just before plunging into the pool, swimmers may perform exercises such as squatting. Squatting helps in enhancing a swimmer\\'s start by warming up the thigh muscles.\\n\\n\\n== Infant swimming ==\\n\\nHuman babies demonstrate an innate swimming or diving reflex from newborn until the age of approximately 6 months. Other mammals also demonstrate this phenomenon (see mammalian diving reflex).  The diving response involves apnea, reflex bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in other words, babies immersed in water spontaneously hold their breath, slow their heart rate, and reduce blood circulation to the extremities (fingers and toes).\\nBecause infants are innately able to swim, classes for babies of about 6 months old are offered in many locations. This helps build muscle memory and makes strong swimmers from a young age.\\n\\n\\n== Technique ==\\n\\nSwimming can be undertaken using a wide range of styles, known as \\'strokes,\\' and these strokes are used for different purposes, or to distinguish between classes in competitive swimming.  It is not necessary to use a defined stroke for propulsion through the water, and untrained swimmers may use a \\'doggy paddle\\' of arm and leg movements, similar to the way four-legged animals swim.\\nThere are four main strokes used in competition and recreation swimming: the front crawl, also known as freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly.  Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke. In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions.  Butterfly was developed in the 1930s, and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953. Butterfly is considered the hardest stroke by many people, but it is the most effective for all-around toning and the building of muscles. It also burns the most calories and can be the second fastest stroke if practiced regularly.In non-competitive swimming, there are some swimming strokes including sidestroke. The sidestroke toward the end of the 19th century, this pattern was changed by raising one arm above the water first, then the other, and then each in turn. It is still used in lifesaving and recreational swimming.\\nOther strokes exist for particular reasons such as training, school lessons, and rescue, and it is often possible to change strokes to avoid using parts of the body, either to separate specific body parts, such as swimming with only arms or legs to exercise them harder, or for amputees or those affected by paralysis.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nSwimming has been recorded since prehistoric times, and the earliest records of swimming date back to Stone Age paintings from around 7,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BCE.  Some of the earliest references include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), Beowulf, and other sagas.\\nThe coastal tribes living in the volatile Low Countries were known as excellent swimmers by the Romans. Men and horses of the Batavi tribe could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. Dio Cassius describes one surprise tactic employed by Aulus Plautius against the Celts at the Battle of the Medway:\\nThe [British Celts] thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of [Batavii], who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. ... Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found, but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the [Batavii] swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them.\\nIn 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read).\\n\\n\\n== Purpose ==\\nThere are many reasons why people swim, from swimming as a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity. Swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries. People may also pursue swimming as a career or field of interest. Some may be gifted and choose to compete professionally and go on to claim fame.\\n\\n\\n=== Recreation ===\\nMany swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to take part in.  Recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation or rehabilitation.  The support of the water, and the reduction in impact, makes swimming accessible for people who are unable to undertake activities such as running. Swimming is one of the most relaxing activities, water is known to calm us and can help reduce stress.\\n\\n\\n=== Health ===\\nSwimming is primarily a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply to the muscles, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically. Furthermore, swimming can help tone and strengthen muscles. Regular swimming can help in weight management and contribute to maintaining a healthy body weight. (Robinson 2022) Swimming allows sufferers of arthritis to exercise affected joints without worsening their symptoms. Swimming is often recommended for individuals with joint conditions or injuries, as the buoyancy of water reduces stress on the joints. However, swimmers with arthritis may wish to avoid swimming breaststroke, as improper technique can exacerbate arthritic knee pain. As with most aerobic exercise, swimming reduces the harmful effects of stress. Swimming is also effective in improving health for people with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses. It is proven to positively impact the mental health of pregnant women and mothers. Swimming can even improve mood. Although many forms of physical activity have been shown to improve bone density and health, this is where swimming has its downfalls. Due to the low-impact nature of the sport, studies have demonstrated that bone mass acquisition will be negatively impacted, which could be an issue for adolescent athletes in particular.\\n\\n\\n==== Disabled swimmers ====\\nSince 2010, the Americans with Disabilities Act has required that swimming pools in the United States be accessible to disabled swimmers.\\n\\n\\n==== Elderly swimmers ====\\n\"Water-based exercise can benefit older adults by improving quality of life and decreasing disability. It also improves or maintains the bone health of post-menopausal women.\"\\nSwimming is an ideal workout for the elderly, as it is a low-impact sport with very little risk of injury. Exercise in the water works out all muscle groups, helping with conditions such as muscular dystrophy which is common in seniors. It is also a common way to relieve pain from arthritis.\\n\\n\\n=== Sport ===\\n\\nSwimming as a sport predominantly involves participants competing to be the fastest over a given distance in a certain period of time.  Competitors swim different distances in different levels of competition. For example, swimming has been an Olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four main strokes and medley.  During the season competitive swimmers typically train multiple times per day and week to increase endurance, strength, and preserve fitness. Furthermore when the cycle of work is completed swimmers go through a stage called taper where intensity is reduced in preparation for competition season. During taper, focus is on power and water feel.\\nThe sport is governed internationally by the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), and competition pools for FINA events are 25 or 50 meters in length. In the United States, a pool 25 yards in length is commonly used for competition.\\nOther swimming and water-related sporting disciplines include open water swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, water polo, triathlon, and the modern pentathlon.\\n\\n\\n=== Safety ===\\n\\nIt is important to prioritize safety when swimming. This includes having lifeguards present, swimming in designated areas, and being aware of potential hazards such as currents and underwater obstacles. \\nAs a popular leisure activity done all over the world, one of the primary risks of swimming is drowning. Drowning may occur from a variety of factors, from swimming fatigue to simply inexperience in the water. From 2005 to 2014, an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings occurred in the United States, approximating 10 deaths a day.To minimize the risk and prevent potential drownings from occurring, lifeguards are often employed to supervise swimming locations such as pools, waterparks, lakes and beaches. Different lifeguards receive different training depending on the sites that they are employed at; i.e. a waterfront lifeguard receives more rigorous training than a poolside lifeguard. Well-known aquatic training services include the National Lifesaving Society and the Canadian Red Cross, which specialize in training lifeguards in North America. \\nLearning basic water safety skills, such as swimming with a buddy and knowing how to respond to emergencies, is essential for swimmers of all levels.\\n\\n\\n=== Occupation ===\\nSome occupations require workers to swim, such as abalone and pearl diving, and spearfishing.\\nSwimming is used to rescue people in the water who are in distress, including exhausted swimmers, non-swimmers who have accidentally entered the water, and others who have come to harm on the water. Lifeguards or volunteer lifesavers are deployed at many pools and beaches worldwide to fulfil this purpose, and they, as well as rescue swimmers, may use specific swimming styles for rescue purposes.\\nSwimming is also used in marine biology to observe plants and animals in their natural habitat. Other sciences use swimming; for example, Konrad Lorenz swam with geese as part of his studies of animal behavior.\\nSwimming also has military purposes. Military swimming is usually done by special operation forces, such as Navy SEALs and US Army Special Forces. Swimming is used to approach a location, gather intelligence, engage in sabotage or combat, and subsequently depart. This may also include airborne insertion into water or exiting a submarine while it is submerged. Due to regular exposure to large bodies of water, all recruits in the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are required to complete basic swimming or water survival training.\\nSwimming is also a professional sport. Companies sponsor swimmers who have the skills to compete at the international level. Many swimmers compete competitively to represent their home countries in the Olympics. Professional swimmers may also earn a living as entertainers, performing in water ballets.\\n\\n\\n=== Locomotion ===\\nLocomotion by swimming over brief distances is frequent when alternatives are precluded. There have been cases of political refugees swimming in the Baltic Sea and of people jumping in the water and swimming ashore from vessels not intended to reach land where they planned to go.\\n\\n\\n== Risks ==\\n\\nThere are many risks associated with voluntary or involuntary human presence in water, which may result in death directly or through drowning asphyxiation. Swimming is both the goal of much voluntary presence and the prime means of regaining land in accidental situations.\\nMost recorded water deaths fall into these categories:\\n\\nPanic occurs when an inexperienced swimmer or a nonswimmer becomes mentally overwhelmed by the circumstances of their immersion, leading to sinking and drowning. Occasionally, panic kills through hyperventilation, even in shallow water.\\nExhaustion can make a person unable to sustain efforts to swim or tread water, often leading to death through drowning. An adult with fully developed and extended lungs has generally positive or at least neutral buoyancy, and can float with modest effort when calm and in still water. A small child has negative buoyancy and must make a sustained effort to avoid sinking rapidly.\\nHypothermia, in which a person loses critical core temperature, can lead to unconsciousness or heart failure.\\nDehydration from prolonged exposure to hypertonic salt water—or, less frequently, salt water aspiration syndrome where inhaled salt water creates foam in the lungs that restricts breathing—can cause loss of physical control or kill directly without actual drowning. Hypothermia and dehydration also kill directly, without causing drowning, even when the person wears a life vest.\\nBlunt trauma in a fast moving flood or river water can kill a swimmer outright, or lead to their drowning.Adverse effects of swimming can include:\\n\\nExostosis, an abnormal bony overgrowth narrowing the ear canal due to frequent, long-term splashing or filling of cold water into the ear canal, also known as surfer\\'s ear\\nInfection from water-borne bacteria, viruses, or parasites\\nChlorine inhalation (in swimming pools)\\nHeart attacks while swimming (the primary cause of sudden death among triathlon participants, occurring at the rate of 1 to 2 per 100,000 participations.)\\nAdverse encounters with aquatic life:\\nStings from sea lice, jellyfish, fish, seashells, and some species of coral\\nPuncture wounds caused by crabs, lobsters, sea urchins, zebra mussels, stingrays, flying fish, sea birds, and debris\\nHemorrhaging bites from fish, marine mammals, and marine reptiles, occasionally resulting from predation\\nVenomous bites from sea snakes and certain species of octopus\\nElectrocution or mild shock from electric eels and electric raysAround any pool area, safety equipment is often important, and is a zoning requirement for most residential pools in the United States. Supervision by personnel trained in rescue techniques is required at most competitive swimming meets and public pools.\\n\\n\\n== Lessons ==\\n\\nTraditionally, children were considered not able to swim independently until 4 years of age,\\nalthough now infant swimming lessons are recommended to prevent drowning.In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Finland, the curriculum for the fifth grade (fourth grade in Estonia) states that all children should learn to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water. Most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim 200 metres (660 ft)—of which at least 50 metres (160 ft) on their back – after first falling into deep water and getting their head under water. Even though about 95 percent of Swedish school children know how to swim, drowning remains the third most common cause of death among children.In both the Netherlands and Belgium swimming lessons under school time (schoolzwemmen, school swimming) are supported by the government. Most schools provide swimming lessons. There is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is even schoolslag (schoolstroke). In France, swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools. Children usually spend one semester per year learning swimming during CP/CE1/CE2/CM1 (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade).\\nIn many places, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies. Many schools also include swimming lessons into their Physical Education curricula, provided either in the schools\\' own pool or in the nearest public pool.\\nIn the UK, the \"Top-ups scheme\" calls for school children who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons. Children who have not reached Great Britain\\'s National Curriculum standard of swimming 25 meters by the time they leave primary school receive a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.In Canada and Mexico there has been a call to include swimming in public school curriculum.In the United States there is the Infant Swimming Resource (ISR) initiative that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with an emergency where they have fallen into the water. They are taught how to roll-back-to-float (hold their breath underwater, to roll onto their back, to float unassisted, rest and breathe until help arrives), while clothed and unclothed. In ISR they teach the children how to roll with their clothes on, as a simulation, if they were to actually fall in walking or crawling by.\\nIn Switzerland, swimming lessons for babies are popular, to help them getting used to be in another element. At the competition level, unlike in other countries - such as the Commonwealth countries, swimming teams are not related to educational institutions (high-schools and universities), but rather to cities or regions.\\n\\n\\n== Clothing and equipment ==\\n\\n\\n=== Swimsuits ===\\n\\nStandard everyday clothing is usually impractical for swimming and is unsafe under some circumstances. Most cultures today expect swimmers to wear swimsuits.\\nMen\\'s swimsuits commonly resemble shorts, or briefs. Men\\'s casual swimsuits (for example, boardshorts) are rarely skintight, unlike competitive swimwear, like jammers or diveskins. In most cases, boys and men swim with their upper body exposed, except in countries where custom or law prohibits it in a public setting, or for practical reasons such as sun protection.\\nModern women\\'s swimsuits are generally skintight, covering the pubic region and the breasts (See bikini). Women\\'s swimwear may also cover the midriff as well. Women\\'s swimwear is often a fashion statement, and whether it is modest or not is a subject of debate by many groups, religious and secular.\\n\\nCompetitive swimwear is built so that the wearer can swim faster and more efficiently. Modern competitive swimwear is skintight and lightweight. There are many kinds of competitive swimwear for each gender. It is used in aquatic competitions, such as water polo, swim racing, diving, and rowing.\\nWetsuits provide both thermal insulation and flotation. Many swimmers lack buoyancy in the leg. The wetsuit provides additional volume at a lower density and therefore improves buoyancy and trim while swimming. It provides insulation between the skin and water which reduces heat loss. The wetsuit is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia.\\nSome people also choose to wear no clothing while swimming. In some European countries public pools allow clothes-free swimming and many countries have beaches where one can swim naked. It is legal to swim naked in the sea at all UK beaches. It was common for males to swim naked in a public setting up to the early 20th century. Today, swimming naked can be a rebellious activity or merely a casual one.\\n\\n\\n=== Accessories ===\\nEar plugs can prevent water from getting in the ears.\\nNoseclips can prevent water from getting in the nose. However, using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause disadvantage, so many competitive swimmer choose not to use one. For this reason, nose clips are primarily used for synchronized swimming and recreational swimming.\\nGoggles protect the eyes from chlorinated water, and improve underwater visibility. Tinted goggles protect the eyes from sunlight that reflects from the bottom of the pool.\\nSwim caps keep the body streamlined and protect the hair from chlorinated water, though they are not entirely watertight.\\nKickboards are used to keep the upper body afloat while exercising the lower body.\\nPull buoys are used to keep the lower body afloat while exercising the upper body.\\nSwimfins are used in training to elongate the kick and improve technique and speed. Fins also build upper calf muscles. Fins provide a significantly greater and more efficient conversion of muscle power to thrust than available from the feet, and allow the powerful leg muscles to be used effectively for propulsion through water. The value of fins as an active aid in the teaching, learning and practice of swimming has long been recognised. In the US, as early as 1947, they were used experimentally to build the confidence of reluctant beginners in swimming, while a 1950 YMCA lifesaving and water safety manual reminded swimming instructors how \"flippers can be used to great advantage for treading water, surface diving, towing, underwater searching and supporting a tired swimmer\". In 1967, research was conducted on fin use in teaching the crawl stroke. During the 1970s, the so-called \"flipper-float\" method came into vogue in Europe with the aim of helping beginners learn to swim faster and more safely,\\nHand paddles are used to increase resistance during arm movements, with the goal of improving technique and power.\\nFinger paddles have a similar effect to handle paddles however due to their smaller size create less resistance. They also help with improving a swimmers \\'catch\\' in the water.\\nSnorkels are used to help improve and maintain a good head position in the water. They may also be used by some during physical therapy.\\nPool noodles are used to keep the user afloat during the time in the water.\\nSafety fencing and equipment is mandatory at public pools and a zoning requirement at most residential pools in the United States.\\nSwimming Parachutes are used in competitive training, adding an element of resistance in the water helping athletes to increase power in the strokes central movements.\\nInflatable armbands are swimming aids designed to provide buoyancy for the swimmer which helps the wearer to float.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nCox, Lynne (2005).

       " 'The marathon (from Greek  Μαραθώνιος) is a long-distance foot race with a distance of 42.195 km (26 mi 385 yd), usually run as a road race, but the distance can be covered on trail routes. The marathon can be completed by running or with a run/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions. More than 800 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896. The distance did not become standardized until 1921. The distance is also included in the World Athletics Championships, which began in 1983. It is the only running road race included in both championship competitions (walking races on the roads are also contested in both).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origin ===\\nThe name Marathon comes from the legend of Pheidippides, the Greek messenger. The legend states that, while he was taking part in the Battle of Marathon, which took place in August or September 490 BC, he witnessed a Persian vessel changing its course towards Athens as the battle was near a victorious end for the Greek army. He interpreted this as an attempt by the defeated Persians to rush into the city to claim a false victory or simply raid, hence claiming their authority over Greek land. It was said that he ran the entire distance to Athens without stopping, discarding his weapons and even clothes to lose as much weight as possible, and burst into the assembly, exclaiming \"we have won!\", before collapsing and dying.The account of the run from Marathon to Athens first appeared in Plutarch\\'s On the Glory of Athens in the first century AD, which quoted from Heraclides Ponticus\\'s lost work, giving the runner\\'s name as either Thersipus of Erchius or Eucles. This was the account adopted by Benjamin Haydon for his painting  Eucles Announcing the Victory of Marathon, published as an engraving in 1836 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Satirist Lucian of Samosata gave one of the earliest accounts similar to the modern version of the story, but its historical veracity is disputed based on its tongue-in-cheek writing and the runner being referred to as Philippides and not Pheidippides.There is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend. The Greek historian Herodotus, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars, mentioned Philippides as the messenger who ran from Athens to Sparta asking for help, and then ran back, a distance of over 240 kilometres (150 mi) each way. In some Herodotus manuscripts, the name of the runner between Athens and Sparta is given as Philippides. Herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from Marathon to Athens, and relates that the main part of the Athenian army, having fought and won the grueling battle, and fearing a naval raid by the Persian fleet against an undefended Athens, marched quickly back from the battle to Athens, arriving the same day.\\n\\nIn 1879, Robert Browning wrote the poem Pheidippides. Browning\\'s poem, his composite story, became part of late 19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend.Mount Pentelicus stands between Marathon and Athens, which means that Philippides would have had to run around the mountain, either to the north or to the south. The latter and more obvious route is followed by the modern Marathon-Athens highway (EO83–EO54), which follows the lay of the land southwards from Marathon Bay and along the coast, then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to Athens, between the foothills of Mounts Hymettus and Penteli, and then gently downhill to Athens proper. This route, as it existed when the Olympics were revived in 1896, was approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) long. It was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races. However, there have been suggestions that Philippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of Mount Penteli to the pass of Dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to Athens. This route is slightly shorter, 35 kilometres (22 mi), but includes a very steep climb over the first 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).\\n\\n\\n=== Modern Olympic marathon ===\\n\\nWhen the modern Olympics began in 1896, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the glory of ancient Greece. The idea of a marathon race came from Michel Bréal, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics, as well as by the Greeks. A selection race for the Olympic marathon was held on 22 March 1896 (Gregorian) that was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes. The winner of the first Olympic marathon, on 10 April 1896 (a male-only race), was Spyridon Louis, a Greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds. The marathon of the 2004 Summer Olympics was run on the traditional route from Marathon to Athens, ending at Panathinaiko Stadium, the venue for the 1896 Summer Olympics. That men\\'s marathon was won by Italian Stefano Baldini in 2 hours 10 minutes and 55 seconds, a record time for this route until the non-Olympics Athens Classic Marathon of 2014, when Felix Kandie lowered the course record to 2 hours 10 minutes and 37 seconds.\\n\\nThe women\\'s marathon was introduced at the 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles, US) and was won by Joan Benoit of the United States with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds.It has become a tradition for the men\\'s Olympic marathon to be the last event of the athletics calendar, on the final day of the Olympics. For many years the race finished inside the Olympic stadium; however, at the 2012 Summer Olympics (London), the start and finish were on The Mall, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio de Janeiro), the start and finish were in the Sambódromo, the parade area that serves as a spectator mall for Carnival.Often, the men\\'s marathon medals are awarded during the closing ceremony (including the 2004 games, 2012 games and 2016 games).\\nThe Olympic men\\'s record is 2:06:32, set at the 2008 Summer Olympics by Samuel Kamau Wanjiru of Kenya.  The Olympic women\\'s record is 2:23:07, set at the 2012 Summer Olympics by Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia. The men\\'s London 2012 Summer Olympic marathon winner was Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda (2:08:01). Per capita, the Kalenjin ethnic group of Rift Valley Province in Kenya has produced a highly disproportionate share of marathon and track-and-field winners.\\n\\n\\n=== Marathon mania ===\\nThe Boston Marathon began on 19 April 1897, and was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics. It is the world\\'s oldest annual marathon, and ranks as one of the world\\'s most prestigious road racing events. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston. Johnny Hayes\\' victory at the 1908 Summer Olympics also contributed to the early growth of long-distance running and marathoning in the United States. Later that year, races around the holiday season including the Empire City Marathon held on New Year\\'s Day 1909 in Yonkers, New York, marked the early running craze referred to as \"marathon mania\". Following the 1908 Olympics, the first five amateur marathons in New York City were held on days that held special meanings: Thanksgiving Day, the day after Christmas, New Year\\'s Day, Washington\\'s Birthday, and Lincoln\\'s Birthday.Frank Shorter\\'s victory in the marathon at the 1972 Summer Olympics would spur national enthusiasm for the sport more intensely than that which followed Hayes\\' win 64 years earlier. In 2014, an estimated 550,600 runners completed a marathon within the United States. This can be compared to 143,000 in 1980. Today marathons are held all around the world on a nearly weekly basis.\\n\\n\\n=== Inclusion of women ===\\nFor a long time after the Olympic marathon started, there were no long-distance races, such as the marathon, for women. Although a few women, such as Stamata Revithi in 1896, had run the marathon distance, they were not included in any official results. Marie-Louise Ledru has been credited as the first woman to complete a marathon, in 1918. Violet Piercy has been credited as the first woman to be officially timed in a marathon, in 1926.Arlene Pieper became the first woman to officially finish a marathon in the United States when she completed the Pikes Peak Marathon in Manitou Springs, Colorado, in 1959. Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to run the Boston Marathon \"officially\" (with a number), in 1967. However, Switzer\\'s entry, which was accepted through an \"oversight\" in the screening process, was in \"flagrant violation of the rules\", and she was treated as an interloper once the error was discovered. Bobbi Gibb had completed the Boston race unofficially the previous year (1966), and was later recognized by the race organizers as the women\\'s winner for that year, as well as 1967 and 1968.\\n\\n\\n== Distance ==\\nThe length of an Olympic marathon was not precisely fixed at first, but the marathon races in the first few Olympic Games were about 40 kilometres (25 mi), roughly the distance from Marathon to Athens by the longer, flatter route. The exact length depended on the route established for each venue.\\n\\n\\n=== 1908 Olympics ===\\n\\nThe International Olympic Committee agreed in 1907 that the distance for the 1908 London Olympic marathon would be about 25 miles or 40 kilometers. The organizers decided on a course of 26 miles from the start at Windsor Castle to the royal entrance to the White City Stadium, followed by a lap (586 yards 2 feet; 536 m) of the track, finishing in front of the Royal Box. The course was later altered to use a different entrance to the stadium, followed by a partial lap of 385 yards to the same finish.\\nThe modern 42.195 km (26.219 mi) standard distance for the marathon was set by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) in May 1921 directly from the length used at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.\\n\\n\\n=== IAAF and world records ===\\n\\nAn official IAAF marathon course is 42.195 km (42 m tolerance only in excess). Course officials add a short course prevention factor of up to one meter per kilometer to their measurements to reduce the risk of a measuring error producing a length below the minimum distance.\\nFor events governed by IAAF rules, it is mandatory that the route be marked so that all competitors can see the distance covered in kilometers. The rules make no mention of the use of miles. The IAAF will only recognize world records that are established at events that are run under IAAF rules. For major events, it is customary to publish competitors\\' timings at the midway mark and also at 5 km splits; marathon runners can be credited with world records for lesser distances recognized by the IAAF (such as 20 km, 30 km and so on) if such records are established while the runner is running a marathon, and completes the marathon course.\\n\\n\\n== Marathon races ==\\n\\nAnnually, more than 800 marathons are organized worldwide. Some of these belong to the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS) which has grown since its foundation in 1982 to embrace over 300 member events in 83 countries and territories. The marathons of Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, New York City and Tokyo form the biennial World Marathon Majors series, awarding $500,000 annually to the best overall male and female performers in the series.\\nIn 2006, the editors of Runner\\'s World selected a \"World\\'s Top 10 Marathons\", in which the Amsterdam, Honolulu, Paris, Rotterdam, and Stockholm marathons were featured along with the five original World Marathon Majors events (excluding Tokyo). Other notable large marathons include United States Marine Corps Marathon, Los Angeles, and Rome. The Boston Marathon is the world\\'s oldest annual marathon, inspired by the success of the 1896 Olympic marathon and held every year since 1897 to celebrate Patriots\\' Day, a holiday marking the beginning of the American Revolution, thereby purposely linking Athenian and American struggle for democracy. The oldest annual marathon in Europe is the Košice Peace Marathon, held since 1924 in Košice, Slovakia. The historic Polytechnic Marathon was discontinued in 1996. The Athens Classic Marathon traces the route of the 1896 Olympic course, starting in Marathon on the eastern coast of Attica, site of the Battle of Marathon of 490 BC, and ending at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.\\nThe Midnight Sun Marathon is held in Tromsø, Norway at 70 degrees north. Using unofficial and temporary courses, measured by GPS, races of marathon distance are now held at the North Pole, in Antarctica and over desert terrain. Other unusual marathons include the Great Wall Marathon on The Great Wall of China, the Big Five Marathon among the safari wildlife of South Africa, the Great Tibetan Marathon – a marathon in an atmosphere of Tibetan Buddhism at an altitude of 3,500 metres (11,500 ft), and the Polar Circle Marathon on the permanent ice cap of Greenland.\\nA few marathons cross international and geographical borders. The Istanbul Marathon is the only marathon where participants run over two continents (Europe and Asia) during the course of a single event. In the Detroit Free Press Marathon, participants cross the US/Canada border twice. The Niagara Falls International Marathon includes one international border crossing, via the Peace Bridge from Buffalo, New York, United States to Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada. In the Three Countries Marathon, participants run through Germany, Switzerland and Austria.On 20 March 2018, an indoor Marathon took place in the Armory in New York City. The 200 m track saw a world record in the women\\'s and men\\'s field. Lindsey Scherf (USA) set the indoor women\\'s world record with 2:40:55. Malcolm Richards (USA) won in 2:19:01 with a male indoor world record.\\n\\n\\n=== Wheelchair division ===\\nMany marathons feature a wheelchair division. Typically, those in the wheelchair racing division start their races earlier than their running counterparts.\\nThe first wheelchair marathon was in 1974 in Toledo, Ohio, won by Bob Hall in 2:54. Hall competed in the 1975 Boston Marathon and finished in 2:58, inaugurating the introduction of wheelchair divisions into the Boston Marathon. From 1977 the race was declared the US National Wheelchair championship. The Boston Marathon awards $10,000 to the winning push-rim athlete. Ernst van Dyk has won the Boston Marathon wheelchair division ten times and holds the world record at 1:18:27, set in Boston in 2004. Jean Driscoll won eight times (seven consecutively) and holds the women\\'s world record at 1:34:22.The New York City Marathon banned wheelchair entrants in 1977, citing safety concerns, but then voluntarily allowed Bob Hall to compete after the state Division of Human Rights ordered the marathon to show cause. The Division ruled in 1979 that the New York City Marathon and New York Road Runners club had to allow wheelchair athletes to compete, and confirmed this at appeal in 1980, but the New York Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that a ban on wheelchair racers was not discriminatory as the marathon was historically a foot race. However, by 1986 14 wheelchair athletes were competing, and an official wheelchair division was added to the marathon in 2000.Some of the quickest people to complete a wheel-chair marathon include Thomas Geierpichler (Austria) who won gold in men\\'s T52-class marathon (no lower limb function) in 1 hr 49 min 7 sec in Beijing China, on 17 September 2008; and, Heinz Frei (Switzerland) who won the men\\'s T54 marathon (for racers with spinal cord injuries) in a time of 1 hr 20 min and 14 sec in Oita, Japan, 31 October 1999.\\n\\n\\n== Statistics ==\\n\\n\\n=== World records and world\\'s best ===\\nWorld records were not officially recognized by the IAAF, now known as World Athletics, until 1 January 2004; previously, the best times for the marathon were referred to as the \\'world best\\'. Courses must conform to World Athletics standards for a record to be recognized. However, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible. Typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters.The current world record time for men over the distance is 2 hours and 35 seconds, set in the Chicago Marathon by Kelvin Kiptum of Kenya on 8 October 2023.\\nThe world record for women was set by Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia in the Berlin Marathon on 24 September 2023, in 2 hours 11 minutes and 53 seconds. This broke the previous record set by  Brigid Kosgei of Kenya in the Chicago Marathon on 13 October 2019, in 2 hours 14 minutes and 4 seconds who broke the record Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain had set over 16 years earlier at the London Marathon.\\n\\n\\n=== All-time Top 25 ===\\nThe following is a list of best times among the Top 25 individuals who ever ran the marathon distance. Subsequent times for each athlete are noted below the table. The data is correct as of 16 October 2023.\\n\\n\\n==== Men ====\\n• All time performance top 25 as December 2023:\\n\\n•All time individual top 25 as December 2023\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nEliud Kipchoge (Kenya) ran a time of 1:59:40.2 at the Ineos 1:59 Challenge in Vienna on 12 October 2019. This event was run with no other competitors, and with the assistance of fuel and hydration on demand, and in-out pacemakers. Therefore, the attempt was not eligible for official ratification. This was faster than his previous assisted run of 2:00:25 at the Nike Breaking2 in Monza on 6 May 2017, which was also ineligible.\\nTitus Ekiru (Kenya) ran a time of 2:02:57 at the Milano City Marathon on 16 May 2021, but was later was disqualified due to doping violations.\\nGeoffrey Mutai (Kenya) ran a time of 2:03:02 at the Boston Marathon on 18 April 2011 that was run on an assisted course (in the case of Boston, a point-to-point, net downhill course in excess of the standards) and is therefore ineligible for record purposes per IAAF rule 260.28\\nMoses Mosop (Kenya) ran a time of 2:03:06 at the Boston Marathon on 18 April 2011 that was run on an assisted course and is therefore ineligible for record purposes per IAAF rule 260.28Below is a list of all other times equal or faster than 2:03:50:\\n\\nEliud Kipchoge also ran 2:03:32 (2017).\\nWilson Kipsang Kiprotich also ran 2:03:23 (2013), 2:03:42 (2011).\\nAlexander Mutiso also ran 2:03:29 (2022).\\nAmos Kipruto also ran 2:03:30 (2020).\\nSisay Lemma also ran 2:03:36 (2019).\\nTamirat Tola also ran 2:03:40 (2022).\\nDennis Kimetto also ran 2:03:45 (2013).\\nBashir Abdi also ran 2:03.47 (2023).\\n\\n\\n==== Women ====\\n•Correct as of January 2024.\\n\\n\\n=== Season\\'s Bests ===\\n\\n\\n=== Oldest marathoner ===\\nFauja Singh, then 100, finished the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, becoming the first centenarian ever to officially complete that distance. Singh, a British citizen, finished the race on 16 October 2011 with a time of 8:11:05.9, making him the oldest marathoner. Because Singh could not produce a birth certificate from rural 1911 Colonial India, the place of his birth, his age could not be verified and his record was not accepted by the official governing body World Masters Athletics.\\nJohnny Kelley ran his last full Boston Marathon at the documented age of 84 in 1992. He previously had won the Boston Marathon in both 1935 and 1945 respectively. Between 1934 and 1950, Johnny finished in the top five 15 times, consistently running in the 2:30s and finishing in second place a record seven times at Boston. A fixture at Boston for more than a half century, his 1992 61st start and 58th finish in Boston is a record which still stands today.\\nGladys Burrill, a 92-year-old Prospect, Oregon woman and part-time resident of Hawaii, previously held the Guinness World Records title of oldest person to complete a marathon with her 9 hours 53 minutes performance at the 2010 Honolulu Marathon. The records of the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, at that time, however, suggested that Singh was overall the oldest marathoner, completing the 2004 London Marathon at the age of 93 years and 17 days, and that Burrill was the oldest female marathoner, completing the 2010 Honolulu Marathon at the age of 92 years and 19 days. Singh\\'s age was also reported to be 93 by other sources.In 2015, 92-year-old Harriette Thompson of Charlotte, North Carolina, completed the Rock \\'n\\' Roll San Diego Marathon in 7 hours 24 minutes 36 seconds, thus becoming the oldest woman to complete a marathon. While Gladys Burrill was 92 years and 19 days old when she completed her record-setting marathon, Harriette Thompson was 92 years and 65 days old when she completed hers.English born Canadian Ed Whitlock is the oldest to complete a marathon in under 3 hours at age 74, and under 4 hours at age 85.\\n\\n\\n=== Youngest marathoner ===\\nBudhia Singh, a boy from Odisha, India, completed his first marathon at age five. He trained under the coach Biranchi Das, who saw potential in him. In May 2006, Budhia was temporarily banned from running by the ministers of child welfare, as his life could be at risk. His coach was also arrested for exploiting and cruelty to a child and was later murdered in an unrelated incident. Budhia is now at a state-run sports academy.The youngest under 4 hours is Mary Etta Boitano at age 7 years, 284 days; under 3 hours Julie Mullin at 10 years 180 days; and under 2:50 Carrie Garritson at 11 years 116 days.\\n\\n\\n=== Participation ===\\nIn 2016, Running USA estimated that there were approximately 507,600 marathon finishers in the United States, while other sources reported greater than 550,000 finishers. The chart below from Running USA provides the estimated U.S. Marathon Finisher totals going back to 1976.\\nMarathon running has become an obsession in China, with 22 marathon races in 2011 increasing to 400 in 2017. In 2015, 75 Chinese runners participated in the Boston Marathon and this increased to 278 in 2017.\\n\\n\\n=== Multiple marathons ===\\nAs marathon running has become more popular, some athletes have undertaken challenges involving running a series of marathons.\\nThe 100 Marathon Club is intended to provide a focal point for all runners, particularly from the United Kingdom or Ireland, who have completed 100 or more races of marathon distance or longer. At least 10 of these events must be United Kingdom or Ireland Road Marathons. Club chairman Roger Biggs has run more than 700 marathons or ultras. Brian Mills completed his 800th marathon on 17 September 2011.\\nSteve Edwards, a member of the 100 Marathon Club, set the world record for running 500 marathons in the fastest average finish time of 3 hours 15 minutes, at the same time becoming the first man to run 500 marathons with an official time below 3 hours 30 minutes, on 11 November 2012 at Milton Keynes, England. The records took 24 years to achieve. Edwards was 49 at the time.Over 350 individuals have completed a marathon in each state of the United States plus Washington, D.C., and some have done it as many as eight times. Beverly Paquin, a 22-year-old nurse from Iowa, was the youngest woman to run a marathon in all 50 states in 2010. A few weeks later, still in 2010, Morgan Cummings (also 22) became the youngest woman to complete a marathon in all 50 states and DC. In 2004, Chuck Bryant of Miami, Florida, who lost his right leg below the knee, became the first amputee to finish this circuit. Bryant has completed a total of 59 marathons on his prosthesis. Twenty-seven people have run a marathon on each of the seven continents, and 31 people have run a marathon in each of the Canadian provinces. In 1980, in what was termed the Marathon of Hope, Terry Fox, who had lost a leg to cancer and so ran with one artificial leg, attained 5,373 km (3,339 mi) of his proposed cross-Canada cancer fundraising run, maintaining an average of over 37 km (23 mi), close to the planned marathon distance, for each of 143 consecutive days.\\nOn 25 September 2011, Patrick Finney of Grapevine, Texas became the first person with multiple sclerosis to finish a marathon in each state of the United States. In 2004, \"the disease had left him unable to walk. But unwilling to endure a life of infirmity, Finney managed to regain his ability to balance on two feet, to walk – and eventually to run – through extensive rehabilitation therapy and new medications.\"In 2003, British adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes completed seven marathons on seven continents in seven days. He completed this feat despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double heart bypass operation just four months before. This feat has since been eclipsed by Irish ultramarathon runner Richard Donovan who in 2009 completed seven marathons on seven continents in under 132 hours (five and a half days). Starting 1 February 2012 he improved on this by completing the 7 on 7 in under 120 hours or in less than five days.On 30 November 2013, 69-year-old Larry Macon set a Guinness World Record for Most Marathons Run in a Year by Man by running 238 marathons. Larry Macon celebrated his 1,000th career marathon at the Cowtown Marathon in Ft. Worth on 24 February 2013.Other goals are to attempt to run marathons on a series of consecutive weekends (Richard Worley on 159 weekends), or to run the most marathons during a particular year or the most in a lifetime. A pioneer in running multiple marathons was Sy Mah of Toledo, Ohio, who ran 524 before he died in 1988. As of 30 June 2007, Horst Preisler of Germany had successfully completed 1214 marathons plus 347 ultramarathons, a total of 1561 events at marathon distance or longer. Sigrid Eichner, Christian Hottas and Hans-Joachim Meyer have also all completed over 1000 marathons each. Norm Frank of the United States is credited with 945 marathons.Christian Hottas is meanwhile the first runner who ever completed 2000 marathons. He ran his 2000th at TUI Marathon Hannover on 5 May 2013 together with a group of more than 80 friends from 11 countries, including 8 officers from the 100 Marathons Clubs U.K., North-America, Germany, Denmark, Austria and Italy. Hottas completed his 2500th marathon on 4 December 2016.In 2010, Stefaan Engels, a Belgian, set out to run the marathon distance every day of the year. Because of a foot injury he had to resort to a handcycle near the end of January 2010. However, on 5 February he was fully recovered and decided to reset the counter back to zero. By 30 March he broke the existing record of Akinori Kusuda, from Japan, who completed 52 marathons in a row in 2009. On 5 February 2011, Engels had run 365 marathon distances in as many days.Ricardo Abad Martínez, from Spain, later ran 150 marathons in 150 consecutive days in 2009, and subsequently 500 marathons in a row, from October 2010 to February 2012.Some runners compete to run the same marathons for the most consecutive years. For example, Johnny Kelley completed 58 Boston Marathons (he entered the race 61 times). Currently, the longest consecutive streak of Boston Marathon finishes—45 in a row—is held by Bennett Beach, of Bethesda, Maryland.\\n\\n\\n== Olympic medalists ==\\n\\n\\n=== Men ===\\n\\n\\n=== Women ===\\n\\n\\n== World Championships medalists ==\\n\\n\\n=== Men ===\\n\\n\\n=== Women ===\\n\\n\\n== General participation ==\\nMost participants do not run a marathon to win. More important for most runners is their personal finishing time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish. Strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance and a run–walk strategy. In 2005, the average marathon time in the U.S. was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women. In 2015, the men\\'s and women\\'s median marathon times were 4 hours 20 minutes 13 seconds and 4 hours 45 minutes 30 seconds respectively.A goal many runners aim for is to break certain time barriers. For example, recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours. Other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons. The Boston Marathon, the oldest marathon in the United States, requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners. The New York City Marathon also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry, at a significantly faster pace than Boston\\'s.Typically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer (eight hours or more). Many marathons around the world have such time limits by which all runners must have crossed the finish line. Anyone slower than the limit will be picked up by a sweeper bus. In many cases the marathon organizers are required to reopen the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal.\\nWith the growth in popularity of marathon-running, many marathons across the United States and the world have been filling to capacity faster than ever before. When the Boston Marathon opened up registration for its 2011 running, the field capacity was filled within eight hours.\\n\\n\\n=== Training ===\\nThe long run is an important element in marathon training. Recreational runners commonly try to reach a maximum of about 32 km (20 mi) in their longest weekly run and a total of about 64 km (40 mi) a week when training for the marathon, but wide variability exists in practice and in recommendations. More experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week. Greater weekly training mileages can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance, but also carry a greater risk of training injury. Most male elite marathon runners will complete weekly distances of over 160 km (100 mi). It is recommended that those new to running should get a checkup from their doctor, as there are certain warning signs and risk factors that should be evaluated before undertaking any new workout program, especially marathon training.Many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally, for recovery, a period of tapering in the one to three weeks preceding the race. For beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of four months of running four days a week is recommended. Many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10%. It is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program, to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses. The marathon training program itself would suppose variation between hard and easy training, with a periodization of the general plan.Training programs can be found at the websites of Runner\\'s World, Hal Higdon, Jeff Galloway, RunnersWorld Tulsa Archived 30 May 2023 at the Wayback Machine, and the Boston Athletic Association, and in numerous other published sources, including the websites of specific marathons.\\nMany local running stores sponsor training programs for the community. RunnersWorld Tulsa Archived 30 May 2023 at the Wayback Machine, for example, has half and full marathon training programs that consider an individual\\'s pace and desired distance. These kinds of groups offer connection to your running community—an invaluable source of support, encouragement, and accountability.\\nThe last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event. Many marathon runners also \"carbo-load\" (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen.\\n\\n\\n=== Glycogen and \"the wall\" ===\\n\\nCarbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage. Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy. Runners can store about 8 MJ or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30 km/18–20 miles of running. Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point. When glycogen runs low, the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat, which does not burn as readily. When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to \"hit the wall\". The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches, is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the \"wall\" is not as dramatic. This is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen.Carbohydrate-based \"energy gels\" are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of \"hitting the wall\", as they provide easy to digest energy during the run. Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine. They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water. Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely.\\nAlternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars, and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily. Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them. Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick. Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race. It is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers (NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration. NSAIDS block the COX-2 enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body, but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention. In less than 5% of the whole population that take NSAIDS, individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition.\\n\\n\\n=== Temperature ===\\nA study of the performance of 1.8 million participants in the Berlin, London, Paris, Boston, Chicago, and New York marathons during the years from 2001 to 2010 found that runners recorded their fastest times when the temperature was around 6 °C (43 °F), with an increase of 10 °C (18 °F) leading to a 1.5% reduction in speed. A July 2020 study found that increasing temperatures affected faster runners\\' performance more than slower ones.\\n\\n\\n=== After a marathon ===\\nMarathon participation may result in various medical, musculoskeletal, and dermatological complaints. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon. Various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to DOMS. Dermatological issues frequently include \"jogger\\'s nipple\", \"jogger\\'s toe\", and blisters.The immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time. Changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction.After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended. In addition, soaking the lower half of the body for approximately 20 minutes in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery.\\n\\n\\n== Health risks ==\\n\\nMarathon running has various health risks, though these can be diminished with preparation and care. Training and the races themselves can put runners under stress. While very rare, even death is a possibility during a race.\\nCommon minor health risks include blisters, tendonitis, fatigue, knee or ankle sprain, dehydration (electrolyte imbalance), and other conditions. Many are categorised as overuse injuries.\\n\\n\\n=== Cardiac health ===\\nIn 2016, a systematic medical review found that the risk of sudden cardiac death during or immediately after a marathon was between 0.6 and 1.9 deaths per 100,000 participants, varying across the specific studies and the methods used, and not controlling for age or gender. Since the risk is small, cardiac screening programs for marathons are uncommon. However, this review was not an attempt to assess the overall cardiac health impact of marathon running.\\nA 2006 study of non-elite Boston Marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins that indicate heart damage or dysfunction (see Troponin) and gave them echocardiogram scans, before and after the marathon. The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had averaged fewer than 56 km (35 mi) of weekly training in the 4 months before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than 72 km (45 mi) of weekly training showed few or no heart problems.According to a Canadian study presented in 2010, running a marathon can temporarily result in decreased function of more than half the muscle segments in the heart\\'s main pumping chamber, but neighboring segments are generally able to compensate. Full recovery is reached within three months. The fitter the runner, the less the effect. The runners with decreased left ventricle function had an average peak weekly training distance of 55.1 km (34.2 mi), while those who did not averaged 69.1 km (42.9 mi). The marathon was held in 35 °C (95 °F) weather. According to one of the researchers: \"Regular exercise reduces cardiovascular risk by a factor of two or three in the long run, but while we\\'re doing vigorous exercise such as marathon running, our cardiac risk increases by seven.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Hydration ===\\nOverconsumption is the most significant concern associated with water consumption during marathons. Drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called exercise-associated hyponatremia, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death. Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, medical director for the New York City Marathon, stated in 2005: \"There are no reported cases of dehydration causing death in the history of world running, but there are plenty of cases of people dying of hyponatremia.\"For example, Dr. Cynthia Lucero died at the age of 28 while participating in the 2002 Boston Marathon. It was Lucero\\'s second marathon. At mile 22, Lucero complained of feeling \"dehydrated and rubber-legged.\" She soon wobbled and collapsed to the ground, and was unconscious by the time the paramedics reached her. Lucero was admitted to Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and died two days later.Lucero\\'s cause of death was determined to be hyponatremic encephalopathy, a condition that causes swelling of the brain due to an imbalance of sodium in the blood known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). While EAH is sometimes referred to as \"water intoxication\", Lucero drank large amounts of Gatorade during the race, demonstrating that runners who consume sodium-containing sports drinks in excess of thirst can still develop EAH. Because hyponatremia is caused by excessive water retention, and not just loss of sodium, consumption of sports drinks or salty foods may not prevent hyponatremia.Women are more prone to hyponatremia than men. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon had hyponatremia.The International Marathon Medical Directors Association (IMMDA) advised in 2006 that fluid intake should be adjusted individually according to factors such as body weight, sex, climate, pace, fitness (VO2 max), and sweat rate, as fluid requirements can vary between people depending on these variables. The IMMDA also recommended sports drinks that include carbohydrates and electrolytes instead of plain water and said that runners should \"drink to thirst\", trying to refrain from drinking at every fluid station before feeling thirsty. Heat exposure leads to diminished thirst drive and thirst may not be a sufficient incentive to drink in many situations. The IMMDA and HSL Harpur Hill give recommendations to drink fluid in small volumes frequently at an approximate rate falling between 100–250 ml (3.4–8.5 US fl oz) every 15 minutes. A patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in the blood. Some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs. If anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water.\\n\\n\\n=== Body temperature ===\\nExertional heat stroke is an emergency condition in which thermoregulation fails and the body temperature rises dangerously above 104 °F (40 °C). It becomes a greater risk in warm and humid weather, even for young and fit individuals. Treatment requires rapid physical cooling of the body.\\n\\n\\n== Charity involvement ==\\nSome charities seek to associate with various races. Some marathon organizers set aside a portion of their limited entry slots for charity organizations to sell to members in exchange for donations. Runners are given the option to sign up to run particular races, especially when marathon entries are no longer available to the general public. In some cases, charities organize their own marathon as a fund-raiser, gaining funds via entry fees or sponsorships.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\nMars rover marathonIn 2015 the Mars rover Opportunity attained the distance of a marathon from its starting location on Mars, and the valley where it achieved this distance was called Marathon Valley, which was then explored.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nRecords\\n\\nMarathon world record progression\\nNational records in the marathonLists\\n\\nList of marathon races\\nList of marathoners\\nList of marathon national champions (men)\\nList of non-professional marathon runnersRelated races\\n\\nEkiden (marathon relays)\\nHalf marathon\\nUltramarathonOther endurance races\\n\\nIronman Triathlon\\nMountain marathon\\nMulti-day race\\nSki marathonOrganizations\\n\\n100 Marathon Club\\nWorld Peace MarathonNotable races\\n\\nIneos 1:59 Challenge\\nMan versus Horse Marathon\\nMarathons at the ParalympicsOther related topics\\n\\nPacemaker (running)\\nPhysiology of marathons\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nHans-Joachim Gehrke, \"From Athenian identity to European ethnicity: The cultural biography of the myth of Marathon,\" in Ton Derks, Nico Roymans (ed.), Ethnic Constructs in Antiquity: The Role of Power and Tradition (Amsterdam, Amsterdam University Press, 2009) (Amsterdam Archaeological Studies, 13), 85–100.\\nHans W.

      "the european central bank (ecb) is the prime component of the eurosystem and the european system of central banks (escb) as well as one of seven institutions of the european union. it is one of the world's most important central banks. the ecb governing council makes monetary policy for the eurozone and the european union, administers the foreign exchange reserves of eu member states, engages in foreign exchange operations, and defines the intermediate monetary objectives and key interest rate of the eu. the ecb executive board enforces the policies and decisions of the governing council, and may direct the national central banks when doing so. the ecb has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ecb beforehand. the bank also operates the target2 payments system. the ecb was established by the treaty of amsterdam in may 1999 with the purpose of guaranteeing and maintaining price stability. on 1 december 2009, the treaty of lisbon became effective and the bank gained the official status of an eu institution. when the ecb was created, it covered a eurozone of eleven members. since then, greece joined in january 2001, slovenia in january 2007, cyprus and malta in january 2008, slovakia in january 2009, estonia in january 2011, latvia in january 2014, lithuania in january 2015 and croatia in january 2023. the current president of the ecb is christine lagarde. seated in frankfurt, germany, the bank formerly occupied the eurotower prior to the construction of its new seat. the ecb is directly governed by european union law. its capital stock, worth €11 billion, is owned by all 27 central banks of the eu member states as shareholders. the initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and gdp, but the capital key has been readjusted since. shares in the ecb are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral. == history == === early years of the ecb (1998–2007) === the european central bank is the de facto successor of the european monetary institute (emi). the emi was established at the start of the second stage of the eu's economic and monetary union (emu) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ecb and european system of central banks (escb). the emi itself took over from the earlier european monetary cooperation fund (emcf).the ecb formally replaced the emi on 1 june 1998 by virtue of the treaty on european union (teu, treaty of maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the introduction of the euro on 1 january 1999, signalling the third stage of emu. the bank was the final institution needed for emu, as outlined by the emu reports of pierre werner and president jacques delors. it was established on 1 june 1998 the first president of the bank was wim duisenberg, the former president of the dutch central bank and the european monetary institute. while duisenberg had been the head of the emi (taking over from alexandre lamfalussy of belgium) just before the ecb came into existence, the french government wanted jean-claude trichet, former head of the french central bank, to be the ecb's first president. the french argued that since the ecb was to be located in germany, its president should be french. this was opposed by the german, dutch and belgian governments who saw duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro. tensions were abated by a gentleman's agreement in which duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by trichet.trichet replaced duisenberg as president in november 2003. until 2007, the ecb had very successfully managed to maintain inflation close but below 2%. === the ecb's response to the financial crises (2008–2014) === the european central bank underwent through a deep internal transformation as it faced the global financial crisis and the eurozone debt crisis. ==== early response to the eurozone debt crisis ==== the so-called european debt crisis began after greece's new elected government uncovered the real level indebtedness and budget deficit and warned eu institutions of the imminent danger of a greek sovereign default. foreseeing a possible sovereign default in the eurozone, the general public, international and european institutions, and the financial community reassessed the economic situation and creditworthiness of some eurozone member states. consequently, sovereign bonds yields of several eurozone countries started to rise sharply. this provoked a self-fulfilling panic on financial markets: the more greek bonds yields rose, the more likely a default became possible, the more bond yields increased in turn.this panic was also aggravated because of the reluctance of the ecb to react and intervene on sovereign bond markets for two reasons. first, because the ecb's legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds in the primary market (article 123. tfeu), an over-interpretation of this limitation, inhibited the ecb from implementing quantitative easing like the federal reserve and the bank of england did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets. secondly, a decision by the ecb made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (bbb-) for all eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ecb's open market operations. this meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ecb refinancing operations. according to former member of the governing council of the ecb athanasios orphanides, this change in the ecb's collateral framework \"planted the seed\" of the euro crisis.faced with those regulatory constraints, the ecb led by jean-claude trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets. up until 6 may 2010, trichet formally denied at several press conferences the possibility of the ecb to embark into sovereign bonds purchases, even though greece, ireland, portugal, spain and italy faced waves of credit rating downgrades and increasing interest rate spreads. ==== ecb's market interventions (2010–2011) ==== in a remarkable u-turn, the ecb announced on 10 may 2010, the launch of a \"securities market programme\" (smp) which involved the discretionary purchase of sovereign bonds in secondary markets. extraordinarily, the decision was taken by the governing council during a teleconference call only three days after the ecb's usual meeting of 6 may (when trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds). the ecb justified this decision by the necessity to \"address severe tensions in financial markets.\" the decision also coincided with the eu leaders decision of 10 may to establish the european financial stabilisation mechanism, which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis.although at first limited to the debt of greece, ireland and portugal, the bulk of the ecb's bond buying eventually consisted of spanish and italian debt. these purchases were intended to dampen international speculation against stressed countries, and thus avoid a contagion of the greek crisis towards other eurozone countries. the assumption—largely justified—was that speculative activity would decrease over time and the value of the assets increase. although smp purchases did inject liquidity into financial markets, all of these injections were \"sterilized\" through weekly liquidity absorption. so the operation was net neutral in liquidity terms (though this was of little practical importance since normal monetary policy operations were ensuring unlimited supplies of liquidity at the main policy interest rate).in september 2011, ecb's board member jürgen stark, resigned in protest against the \"securities market programme\" which involved the purchase of sovereign bonds from southern member states, a move that he considered as equivalent to monetary financing, which is prohibited by the eu treaty. the financial times deutschland referred to this episode as \"the end of the ecb as we know it\", referring to its hitherto perceived \"hawkish\" stance on inflation and its historical deutsche bundesbank influence.as of 18 june 2012, the ecb in total had spent €212.1bn (equal to 2.2% of the eurozone gdp) for bond purchases covering outright debt, as part of the securities markets programme. controversially, the ecb made substantial profits out of smp, which were largely redistributed to eurozone countries. in 2013, the eurogroup decided to refund those profits to greece, however, the payments were suspended from 2014 until 2017 over the conflict between yanis varoufakis and ministers of the eurogroup. in 2018, profits refunds were reinstalled by the eurogroup. however, several ngos complained that a substantial part of the ecb profits would never be refunded to greece. ==== role in the troika (2010–2015) ==== the ecb played a controversial role in the \"troika\" by rejecting most forms of debt restructuring of public and bank debts, and pressing governments to adopt bailout programmes and structural reforms through secret letters to italian, spanish, greek and irish governments. it has further been accused of interfering in the greek referendum of july 2015 by constraining liquidity to greek commercial banks. in november 2010, reflecting the huge increase in borrowing, including the cover the cost of having guaranteed the liabilities of banks, the cost of borrowing in the private financial markets had become prohibitive for the irish government. although it had deferred the cash cost of recapitalising the failing anglo irish bank by nationalising it and issuing it with a \"promissory note\" (an iou), the government also faced a large deficit on its non-banking activities, and it therefore turned to the official sector for a loan to bridge the shortfall until its finances were credibly back on a sustainable footing. (meanwhile, anglo used the promissory note as collateral for its emergency loan (ela) from the central bank. this enabled anglo was able to repay its depositors and bondholders. it became clear later that the ecb played a key role in making sure the irish government did not let anglo default on its debts, to avoid financial instability risks. on 15 october and 6 november 2010, the ecb president jean-claude trichet sent two secret letters to the irish finance minister which essentially informed the irish government of the possible suspension of ela's credit lines, unless the government requested a financial assistance programme to the eurogroup under the condition of further reforms and fiscal consolidation. in addition, the ecb insisted that no debt restructuring (or bail-in) should be applied to the nationalized banks' bondholders, a measure which could have saved ireland 8 billion euros.during 2012, the ecb pressed for an early end to the ela, and this situation was resolved with the liquidation of the successor institution ibrc in february 2013. the promissory note was exchanged for much longer term marketable floating rate notes which were disposed of by the central bank over the following decade. in april 2011, the ecb raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 from 1% to 1.25%, with a further increase to 1.50% in july 2011. however, in 2012–2013 the ecb sharply lowered interest rates to encourage economic growth, reaching the historically low 0.25% in november 2013. soon after the rates were cut to 0.15%, then on 4 september 2014 the central bank reduced the rates by two-thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%. recently, the interest rates were further reduced reaching 0.00%, the lowest rates on record.in a report adopted on 13 march 2014, the european parliament criticized the \"potential conflict of interest between the current role of the ecb in the troika as 'technical advisor' and its position as a creditor of the four member states, as well as its mandate under the treaty\". the report was led by austrian right-wing mep othmar karas and french socialist mep liem hoang ngoc. ==== the ecb's response under mario draghi (2012–2015) ==== on 1 november 2011, mario draghi replaced jean-claude trichet as president of the ecb. this change in leadership also marks the start of a new era under which the ecb will become more and more interventionist and eventually ended the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. draghi's presidency started with the impressive launch of a new round of 1% interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) – the long-term refinancing operations (ltro). under this programme, 523 banks tapped as much as €489.2 bn (us$640 bn). observers were surprised by the volume of loans made when it was implemented. by far biggest amount of €325bn was tapped by banks in greece, ireland, italy and spain. although those ltros loans did not directly benefit eu governments, it effectively allowed banks to do a carry trade, by lending off the ltros loans to governments with an interest margin. the operation also facilitated the rollover of €200bn of maturing bank debts in the first three months of 2012. ===== \"whatever it takes\" (26 july 2012) ===== facing renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone continued mario draghi made a decisive speech in london, by declaring that the ecb \"...is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. and believe me, it will be enough.\" in light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, draghi's statement has been seen as a key turning point in the eurozone crisis, as it was immediately welcomed by european leaders, and led to a steady decline in bond yields for eurozone countries, in particular spain, italy and france.following up on draghi's speech, on 6 september 2012 the ecb announced the outright monetary transactions programme (omt). unlike the previous smp programme, omt has no ex-ante time or size limit. however, the activation of the purchases remains conditioned to the adherence by the benefitting country to an adjustment programme to the esm. the program was adopted with near unanimity, the bundesbank president jens weidmann being the sole member of the ecb's governing council to vote against it.even if omt was never actually implemented until today, it made the \"whatever it takes\" pledge credible and significantly contributed to stabilizing financial markets and ending the sovereign debt crisis. according to various sources, the omt programme and \"whatever it takes\" speeches were made possible because eu leaders previously agreed to build the banking union. === low inflation and quantitative easing (2015–2019) === in november 2014, the bank moved into its new premises, while the eurotower building was dedicated to hosting the newly established supervisory activities of the ecb under european banking supervision.although the sovereign debt crisis was almost solved by 2014, the ecb started to face a repeated decline in the eurozone inflation rate, indicating that the economy was going towards a deflation. responding to this threat, the ecb announced on 4 september 2014 the launch of two bond buying purchases programmes: the covered bond purchasing programme (cbpp3) and asset-backed securities programme (abspp).on 22 january 2015, the ecb announced an extension of those programmes within a full-fledge \"quantitative easing\" programme which also included sovereign bonds, to the tune of 60 billion euros per month up until at least september 2016. the programme was started on 9 march 2015.on 8 june 2016, the ecb added corporate bonds to its asset purchases portfolio with the launch of the corporate sector purchase programme (cspp). under this programme, it conducted the net purchase of corporate bonds until january 2019 to reach about €177 billion. while the programme was halted for 11 months in january 2019, the ecb restarted net purchases in november 2019.as of 2021, the size of the ecb's quantitative easing programme had reached 2947 billion euros. ==== long term refinancing operations (ltro) ==== the long term refinancing operations (ltro) are regular open market operations providing financing to credit institutions for periods up to four years. they aim at favoring lending conditions to the private sector and more generally stimulating bank lending to the real economy, thereby fostering growth. in december 2011 and january 2012, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the ecb implemented two ltros, injecting over €1000 billions of liquidity in the eurozone financial system. they were later criticized for their inability to revive growth and to help truly revive the real economy, despite having stabilized the eurozone’s financial institutions. further, these operations were devoid of monitoring from the ecb regarding the use made of these liquidities and it appeared that banks had significantly used these funds to pursue carry-trade strategies, purchasing sovereign bonds with higher rates and corresponding maturity to generate profits, instead of increasing private lending.these critics and deficiencies brought the ecb to instigate targeted long term refinancing operations (tltros), first in september and later in december 2014. these complementary programs imposed conditionality on the ltros. the tltros provided low cost financing to participating banks, under the condition that they reached certain targets in terms of lending to firms and households. the participating banks were thus more incited to lend to the real economy. a third wave of tltro’s was announced on 7 march 2019, namely the tltro iii. === christine lagarde's era (2019– ) === in july 2019, eu leaders nominated christine lagarde to replace mario draghi as ecb president. lagarde resigned from her position as managing director of the international monetary fund in july 2019 and formally took over the ecb's presidency on 1 november 2019.lagarde immediately signalled a change of style in the ecb's leadership. she embarked the ecb on a strategic review of the ecb's monetary policy strategy, an exercise the ecb had not done for 17 years. as part of this exercise, lagarde committed the ecb to look into how monetary policy could contribute to address climate change, and promised that \"no stone would be left unturned.\" the ecb president also adopted a change of communication style, in particular in her use of social media to promote gender equality, and by opening dialogue with civil society stakeholders. === covid-19 === the onset of the covid-19 pandemic has precipitated an unprecedented crisis, profoundly impacting global public health, economies, and societal structures on an unparalleled scale. the covid-19 crisis stands in contrast to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis as it represents an exogenous shock to the real economy, stemming from measures implemented to mitigate the public health emergency, distinct from the internal financial origins of the preceding crisis that transposed repercussions onto the real economy. following the measures implemented by all governments to counter the spread of covid-19 across europe, investors fled to safety, which caused the risk of fire sales in asset markets, illiquidity spirals, credit spikes and discontinuities associated with market freezes. the flight-to-safety also encouraged the fear that after the covid-19 crisis was over, the stronger economies would emerge even stronger, while the weak economies would get even weaker. thanks to the more stringent banking regulations implemented after the global financial crisis, a financial crisis was avoided as banks could cope better with the crisis and complementary measures were taken by the eu and national governments. ==== pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) ==== the pandemic asset purchase programme (pepp) is an asset purchase programme initiated by the ecb to counter the detrimental effects to the euro area economy caused by the covid-19 crisis. to counter the covid-19 crisis the ecb has established the pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp), in which the ecb is able to purchase securities from the private and public sector in a flexible manner, with the purpose to prevent sovereign debt spreads to reach the same levels as during the european debt crisis. it is a quantitative easing unconventional monetary policy, based on the principles of the asset purchases program (app) which is a similar programme established by the ecb in mid-2014. asset purchase programmes are intended to bring down risk premia or term premia. however, the pepp is not entirely the same as the app, as it can deviate from the capital key strategy followed by the app. second, the pepp-envelope does not need to be used in full. the pepp is established as a separate purchase programme from and in addition to the app with the sole purpose to respond to the economic and financial consequences of the covid-19 crisis. following philip r. lane, chief economist of the ecb, the pepp plays a dual role in the covid-19 crisis: (i) ensuring price stability and at the same time (ii) stabilizing the market using the flexibility of the programme to prevent market fragmentation. national central banks are the main purchasers of the bonds under the principle of risk sharing: private bonds fall completely under the risk of national central banks, while only 20% of public bonds are subject to risk sharing. these purchases under the pepp eventually follow the capital key used in the app.the flexibility to deviate from the capital key is key for the pepp: because of the uncertainty caused by covid-19 it was needed to prevent tightening financial conditions. they prevent yield spreads between the bonds of different member states, caused by the flight-to-safety of investors. the flexibility in asset purchases allows for fluctuations in the distribution of purchases across asset classes and among jurisdictions to prevent market fragmentation. following this strategy, the pepp distributed the money among countries in need. the app follows the capital key strategy, from which no deviations are possible. this makes the app not able to counter the crisis effectively. margrethe vestager, european commissioner for competition argued \"we will need to distribute in order to recover together. these increasing asymmetries will otherwise fragment the single market to a level otherwise none of us is willing to accept,[...].\", as economists feared that the strong economies would come out of the crisis stronger while weak economies would deteriorate because of the crisis. the pepp is thus a tool used by the ecb to purchase both private and public securities according to the specific needs of eu-countries caused by the covid-19-crisis. the temporal flexibility from the capital key meant that the ecb could especially prevent the rise of italian and spanish yield spreads. ===== assets eligible under the pepp ===== assets meeting the eligibility criteria of the app were also eligible under the pepp. however, the pepp complemented the app eligibility framework given the specificity of the pepp-context of crisis requiring a more tailored response. among the distinctions is that for the first time since the greek government-debt crisis, greek debt is given a waiver under the pepp so that it could be purchased by the ecb under this programme. this waiver was given based on several considerations from the ecb: there was a need to alleviate the pressures stemming from the pandemic on the greek financial markets; greece was already and would be closely monitored by giving the waiver; and greece regained market access. this proved to be controversial, as greece is the eurozone's riskiest issuer. non-financial commercial paper with a remaining maturity of at least 28 days was also eligible for purchase under the pepp. the maturity criteria for public sector ranges form 70 days up to 30 years and 364 days. as the pepp can deviate from the capital key strategy, there is also no hard limit on the 33% of a single security per issuer or 33% of a member state's total outstanding security. ===== timeline of the pepp and tltro announcements and purchases ===== on 12 march 2020, christine lagarde announced in a press conference a set of policy measures to support the european economy in the rising wake of the pandemic, saying that \"all the flexibilities that are embedded in the framework of the asset purchase programme [...]\" but at the same time she stated that the ecb \"[...] is not here to close spreads.\" this left markets disappointed and let to a particular widening yield spreads in spain, italy and greece. however, the governing council announced firstly to provide immediate liquidity through conducting additional ltros; secondly, to provide more favorable terms on the tltro iii operations outstanding in the period between june 2020 and june 2021; and thirdly, to announce an additional package of net asset purchases of €120 billion by the end of 2020 under the already existing app.a day later, on 13 march 2020, the who declared europe the centre of the pandemic.by march 17, a week after the press conference given by ms. lagarde, stock index plateaued while the interest rate spread kept on rising over 2.8%.on 18 of march 2020, 6 days after the previous press conference, the ecb announced the launch of the pepp worth €750 billion to boost liquidity in the european economy and to contain any sharp increases in sovereign yield spreads. this announcement led to an immediate reboot in stock prices and came one day after the spike of sovereign risk spreads. the pepp became effective as from 24 march 2020, six days after the announcement of the pepp. by announcing the pepp the ecb deviated from its pattern of prodding fiscal authorities into action before announcing any monetary stimulus. together with the additional €120 billion announced on march 12, the pepp amounted up to 7.3% of the euro-area gdp.on 30 april 2020, the ecb governing council introduced the pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (peltros), with an interest rate of 25bp below the average rate applied in ltros and for the first time negative.on 4 june 2020, the ecb announced it would expand the pepp by another €600 billion, as it became clear that the pandemic would continue to harm european economies increasing the total emergency package up to €1.350 trillion. following carsten brzeski, chief economist at ing, dents this ecb decision \"[...] any further speculation about whether or not the ecb is willing to play its role of lender of last resort for the eurozone.\" the expansion showed that the ecb is committed to achieve the price stability objective. however the ecb reiterated that additional fiscal measures should be taken, as the pepp cannot deliver economic recovery on its own.half a year later, on 10 december 2020, the ecb announced its final expansion of the pepp worth another €500 billion, totalling the final pepp to €1.850 trillion, corresponding to 15.4% of the euro-area gdp of 2019. at the same press conference, the ecb announced that it expected to extend the horizon for net purchases of the pepp until at least the end of march 2022. in december 2021 the ecb announced that it would discontinue net purchases under the pepp as from the end of march 2022 and that it intended to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities at least until the end of 2024.on 31 march 2022, at the end of the net purchases, the net purchases amounted to €1.718 billion euros, of which €1.665 billion is invested in public sector securities and €52 billion in private sector securities. of the total €1.850 billion available under the pepp, 93% of the full envelope wase used, due to indications of decreased financial stress in the euro area, mainly thanks to relaxation of covid restrictions and the reopening of european markets. ===== supports and critiques ===== on 13 march, after ms. lagarde stated that the ecb is \"not here to close spreads\", italian sovereign yield spreads spiked. italian prime minister conte stated it would not accept formal and abstract interpretations of the situation. \"[...] the job of the central bank should be not to hinder but to help such [containment] measures by creating favorable financial conditions for them [member states].\" lagarde then replied by stating that the ecb was \"fully committed to avoid any fragmentation [...].\" in the following week, the pepp was welcomed by both the prime minister of italy and spain as well as by the president of france. they all mostly praise the action of the ecb, and put this as a question of european solidarity. chief economist at berenberg also welcomed the measures undertaken by the ecb, stating that \"the authorities would not allow the pandemic shock to the real economy to trigger a financial crisis which, in turn, would exacerbate the economic damage.\" the governor of the banque de france warned the ecb that it probably needed \"[...] to go even further.\"following italian lawmaker for the european parliament carlo calenda there is widespread strong anti-german and anti-dutch sentiment in the south of europe, as it seems they \"[...] are taking advantage of being strong in a europe lacking solidarity.\" these comments are backed by dutch mep paul tang: \"if we fail to take action at european level, we risk disintegrating the single market and intensifying the antagonism between north and south.\"at the same time, the ecb risks being accused of financing governments if it let the pepp last for multiple years. ==== pepp challenged before the german federal constitutional court ==== on may 5, 2020, the court ordered the bundestag and the bundesregierung to ensure the ecb had carried out a proportionality assessment of the vast purchases of government debt in the public sector purchase programme (pspp) to ensure the economic and fiscal policy effects do not outweigh its policy objectives. the pspp-implementing decision has been considered an act ultra vires by the ecb as it was too arbitrary and lacks reasoning in ints proportionality assessment. this ruling by the german constitutional court comes at a difficult time for the ecb as it was at the time considering expanding the pepp. the ruling also reflects the mistrust within some parts of germany in the ecb, which is seen there s an institution that bails out profligate southern european countries. moreover this ruling also highlights the vital problem on the euro area architecture, as the range of instruments can use to fulfil its mandate remains unclear. the ruling on the legality of the pspp could have severe implications on the legality of the pepp, as it the pepp has characteristics in common with the pspp. in march 2021, the pepp was challenged before the german federal constitutional court.covid-19, tltro iii and peltros when the covid-19 pandemic broke out and spread to the old continent, the ecb’s monetary policy response had to guarantee favorable borrowing conditions to firms and households of the euro area. for a significant portion of companies, especially the small and medium-sized, survival was basically at stake. oftentimes, loans are indeed their only source of finance. in this context of uncertainty, a substantial segment of the ecb response was to adapt the existing tltro iii, by providing banks with funding at favorable conditions, to further enhance access to credit for undertakings and households.in this endeavor, the ecb had to ensure a high degree of participation from the banks. hence, on 30 april 2020 the governing council of the ecb adopted a package of temporary measures that made several adjustments to the framework of its tltro iii. an important feature of this response was that the ecb made temporary alterations to its collateral framework by widening the set of assets that could be mobilized as collateral in the liquidity-providing operations and by easing the requirements in this regard. furthermore, a key change was that the ecb also reduced the interest rate applied to these open market operations to a rate going as low as -1% for the banks meeting the lending threshold of 0%. with the tltro iii, the participating banks were thus enabled to borrow at lower interest rates than those paid on their excess reserve, that is to say, the liquidities held in their accounts in their respective central banks. this scheme was scheduled until june 2022. furthermore, the banks’ repayment options were loosened, along with the participation modalities. regarding the latter, the ecb anticipated future potential falls in the ratings of some assets, and therefore established that if the requirements of collateral eligibility had been met prior to april 7, 2020, these assets would remain eligible in the collateral framework, as long as their rating remained above or at a given threshold (credit quality step 5). the ecb also expanded bank’s borrowing allowance under tltro iii from 30% to 50%, then up to 55% of their portfolio of loans to firms and households.another important facet of the ecb policy response was the launching of pandemic emergency long-term refinancing operations (peltros). these are complements to the multiple recalibrations of the tltro iii. on 30 april 2020, the ecb governing council announced these additional long-term loans programs. they are similar to the tltro iii in their aim of ensuring liquidity in the market and smoothening borrowing conditions in these times of pandemic. for this purpose, the peltro’s also provide collateral easing measures and negative interest rates. on december 10, 2020, the ecb issued four additional peltro’s, taking place on a quarterly basis during 2021.during the pandemic, these monetary responses proved essential to counter the loss of revenue suffered by firms and the spurt of demand for loans that naturally ensued. in their absence, a credit crunch would normally have taken place. indeed, increase in demand traditionally translates in a rise of borrowing costs. however, ecb easing measures allowed banks to lend massively without an increase of the rates. empirical evidence is paramount in order to properly assess if the effects on the real economy of those cheaper fundings offered to banks have indeed matched the intention of the european central bank (stimulate the granting of loans to undertakings and households). reports from various member states central banks on the matter indicate that loans supply by participating banks has indeed expanded, in line with the ecb policy. accordingly, thorough academic studies have confirmed the actual enhancement of financing conditions and the avoidance of credit scarcity. in fact, the credit to firms attained unprecedented levels when from march to may 2020, it increased by €250 billion on aggregate.in addition, the massive involvement of banks in the tltros and peltros had an important positive side effect. there was a reduction in the issuance of bonds by banks, that usually showed a preference for central bank liquidity for their financing. this, in turn, prevented the cost of issuance of such bonds from surging, which suggests that even non-participating banks (to the tltros and peltros) benefited from it in parallel manners. the downward pressure on bonds yields also implies that banks having a bigger fraction of the assets side of their balance sheet composed of outstanding bonds were those that benefited the most from the tltros and their decrease of funding cost.furthermore, the question of “zombie firms” has been raised. these refer to unprofitable businesses that only survive by perpetuating their indebtedness. the pandemic, along with the accommodating funding costs (notably brought through the readjustment of the tltro iii), could have led to an increased number of those under-competitive firms allowed to survive by successive credits. yet, scientific studies have shown that this increase was very limited from 2019 to 2020. ==== transmission protection instrument (tpi) ==== the transmission protection instrument (tpi) is a tool the ecb could use to ensure monetary policy decisions are smoothly transmitted across all euro area countries, introduced on july 21, 2022. under the tpi, the ecb would be able to purchase securities in the secondary market, to counter against \"unwanted, disorderly market dynamics\", self fulfilling crises market expectations that do not reflect reality, thus not justified by \"country specific fundamentals.\" the tpi thus enables the ecb to control the difference between borrowing costs across the euro area, thereby reducing fragmentation risk across the euro area. by not letting interfere market dynamics that do not reflect economic reality, the ecb fulfils its secondary mandate under the tfeu, namely \"to support the general economic policies of the union.\" although pepp would remain the first line of defence to counter for transmission risks, the tpi should be seen as an addition to the ecb's toolkit. ===== eligible securities under the tpi ===== contrary to the pepp and the app, the tpi does not have an ex ante upper limit on the purchase of securities. although the ecb has stated it would primarily buy only government bonds on the secondary market maturing between 1 and 10 years, the bonds purchased fall under the complete discretion of the ecb and does not necessarily follow the capital key, and private securities could be considered as well. however, there are four conditions that need to be met before securities are eligible for purchasing under tpi: compliance with the fiscal framework of the eu and not be involved in the excessive deficit procedure; absence of macroeconomic imbalances and not being involved in an excessive macroeconomic imbalance procedure, demonstrating that it is in compliance with the commission's recommendations; sovereign debt trajectory must be sustainable, assessed by the ecb and other relevant bodies; stick to commitments made under the recovery and resilience facility, proving that the government follows sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies.the conditions for government bonds to be eligible under the tpi draw heavily on the macroeconomic governance, and making sure that politicians do not take decisions that facilitate speculation. the decision by the ecb to support a country by using the tpi will depend on the severity of the risks a country faces. government debt should thus be sustainable to be eligible for tpi purchases.if the aforementioned conditions are met, the ecb could decide to activate the tpi. purchases will be ended under the tpi either due to increased transmission of monetary policy or the risks have proven to be country-specific. so far, the tpi has not been deployed yet. ===== effects of and critiques on the tpi ===== the tpi enables the governing council to a more rapid increase in interest rate, the first raise in interest rates by the ecb in 11 years. and the unpredictable nature of market sentiment could justify the reason for ecb-intervention to stabilise the monetary union, more or less the same reasoning as for the pepp. however, the relationship between the pepp and the tpi raises questions as the pepp would remain the first line of defence against transmission risks. the creation of the tpi seems legally vulnerably: problems in the euro area are common and recurring, but it is not automatically the argument to invent a whole new anti-fragmentation tool. with the tpi, the ecb can put pressure on countries by assessing publicly if they are eligible for the tpi, that is assessing whether the government has conducted adequate fiscal policies and structural reforms to deserve the support of the ecb. this endangers the politic neutrality of the ecb. if ever deployed, the usage of the tpi will spark controversy as the conditions to be deployed are not watertight. ===== strategy review ===== as a consequence of the covid-19 crisis, the ecb extended the duration of the strategy review until september 2021. on 13 july 2021, the ecb presented the outcomes of the strategy review, with the main following announcements: the ecb announced a new inflation target of 2% instead of its \"close but below two per cent\" inflation target. the ecb also made it clear it could overshoot its target under certain circumstances. the ecb announced it would try to incorporate the cost of housing (imputed rents) into its inflation measurement the ecb announced an action plan on climate changethe ecb also said it would carry out another strategy review in 2025. === inflation surge of 2021 === in the summer of 2021, coinciding with the european central bank's announcement of its revised monetary policy framework and its initiative for climate action, the eurozone witnessed a notable inflationary surge. this resurgence of inflation continued to escalate over the following year, culminating in inflation rates reaching double digits for the first time since the 1970s, a year after the ecb's strategic updates. the inflation rate reached an unprecedented peak of 4.9% in november 2021, marking the highest level since the introduction of the euro. ==== framing of the crisis ==== the new era of inflation prompted a significant shift in the european central bank's framing compared to its stance in the 2000s. initially, from its inception until the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the ecb's primary objective was price stability, adhering to strict institutional rules that minimized policy trade-offs with other goals beyond price stability. this approach was rooted in the \"central bank independence template\", advocating that central bank's limited role to price stability and its independence were optimal.however, the post-financial crisis landscape, especially during the sovereign debt crisis of the 2010s and subsequent economic stagnation era, necessitated a substantial revision in the ecb's strategy. the ecb moved away from its original central bank independence template, leading to a blurring of its objective hierarchy. it adopted new strategies such as acting as a lender of last resort for the banking system and fostering growth through very low interest rates and extensive asset purchase programs, which were designed to help stabilizing specific market segments and in the end revive growth.in 2021, the european central bank embraced a significant strategic pivot by adopting its climate action plan along with a new monetary policy strategy. this shift aimed to institutionalize the ecb's evolving role, moving beyond the singular focus on price stability—a policy shaped largely by the aftermath of the european sovereign debt crisis. instead, the ecb began acknowledging its multifaceted responsibilities, which now include maintaining financial stability, supporting economic growth, and addressing climate-related objectives. however, with the surging of inflation in 2021, some wondered as to whether the european central bank would revert to its foundational role, predominantly focused on chasing the “inflation monsters”. the term “inflation monsters'' echoes the 2010 video of the ecb where two young people are facing a blue inflation monster unleashing banknotes and threatening to wreck the economy. nevertheless, ecb policymakers effectively drew connections between the central bank independence (cbi) framework and the experiences of the stagflation era to rationalize their decision to increase interest rates, avoiding the need for a discourse on regime change. in doing so, they recognized the complex trade-offs inherent in balancing various macroeconomic objectives and the challenging decisions they had to face.it was with this new monetary strategy that the eurozone found itself facing rising inflation in 2021. recent studies stated that key debate among policymakers centered on whether this inflationary trend would be transitory or permanent. paul krugman argued that the current inflationary surge would prove to be transitory, whereas other economists such as olivier blanchard and larry summers had issued warnings regarding the possible persistence of this inflation. initially, both the european central bank and the federal reserve misjudged the situation, assuming the inflation spike to be temporary and expecting a swift return to their inflation target. this misperception led to the ecb's initial inaction regarding its monetary policy. ==== response to the 2021 inflation crisis ==== after big increases in the inflation rates throughout 2021 and 2022, the european central bank and the fed finally decided to raise their interest rates and abandon their very low interest rates, for the first time since the sovereign debt crisis and the end of the cbi era, as it had become clear the inflationary trend wasn’t temporary. this decision came in late july 2022 for the ecb, when the inflation rate in the eurozone was already at 8.9% and had been higher than the 2% target for more than a year, and in march 2022 for the fed. the european central bank's response to the federal reserve's actions can partly be attributed to concerns about imported inflation from the usa. specifically, if the fed increases its policy rates while the ecb remains static, it could lead to a depreciation of the euro against the dollar. such a scenario would likely result in higher import costs for the eurozone, as many global trade goods are priced in dollars. on the other hand, this would benefit the us economy by making imports from the eurozone cheaper.furthermore, the impact of us dollar appreciation, following the fed's policy rate hikes, tends to be more pronounced in the international inflation rates of energy and food. these commodities are commonly priced in us dollars, making their inflation rates more sensitive to exchange rate variations. in the european union, public inflation expectations are significantly influenced by the prices of energy and food. thus, this form of imported inflation can further exacerbate overall inflation levels of the eurozone. the ecb also declared its intention to systematically diminish net asset purchases within their asset purchase program (app) and end them under the pandemic emergency purchase program (pepp) launched during the covid crisis by the first trimester of 2022. on the other hand, the federal reserve initiated the reduction of its asset purchase program in november 2021, to finally stop it by march 2022. the asset purchase programs of the ecb initially boosted asset values on bank balance sheets and led to expectations of lower future short short-term interest rates. these programs also raised inflation expectations, eventually reanchoring long-term inflation expectations. phasing out the asset purchase programs thus signals alignment with the different policy rate hikes in an attempt to cool down the economy and demonstrates a commitment to combating inflation.research indicates that the european central bank responded to the escalating inflation more slowly and cautiously than the fed, showing hopes that a moderate tightening of monetary policy would suffice. the ecb was notably slower in acknowledging the mistaken nature of its initial assumption that the inflationary trend would be transitory. the transition away from extremely low interest rates was soon accompanied by various rate increases, culminating in the ecb's main rate reaching 4% by the end of september. in contrast, the fed's latest rate hike elevated the effective federal funds rate to 5.33% in august, underscoring a more aggressive and rapid tightening of monetary policy compared to the ecb's approach. however, the global monetary tightening cycle turned out to be the most synchronized one in the past half-century. by february 2023, more than 90% of economies had hiked their policy rates. the latest peak of highly synchronized action by central banks was during the 1970s and the oil prices shocks where 70% of them had raised their interest rates. ==== critics regarding the new monetary policy ==== criticism first emerged regarding the methodologies used for inflation estimation and their failure to anticipate the inflation surge. a primary critique focused on the inadequacy of traditional tools like the phillips curve, which examines the relationship between inflation and certain economic activity indicators, for accurately forecasting inflation. during the 1970s, the phillips curve also faced significant criticism for its inability to accurately predict the inflation experienced in that decade. this period marked a critical reassessment of the curve's predictive capacity, particularly in the context of the economic phenomena of the time. traditional indicators used for forecasting economic dynamics, such as the output and unemployment gaps, were found to be inadequate in signaling the overheating of the economy and the prevailing tight labor market conditions. moreover, the important belief among central banks that sustained inflationary increases are a consequence of unanchored long-term inflation expectations was challenged during 2021-2022. during this period, inflation expectations remained relatively stable, leading to the misinterpretations by the european central bank and other monetary authorities regarding the inflationary trend's nature. both the fed and the ecb argued that the rise in inflation was only temporary and was the sole result of post-pandemic supply disruptions on a few selected goods and services (food and energy). the fed and the ecb then maintained their expansionary monetary policy, keeping interest rates low.some critics have also emerged saying that it was complicated for independent central banks, including the ecb, to accurately assess during a synchronized policy rate hike the potential spillovers of cross-countries monetary policy on the inflation. this might lead to excessive monetary tightening (higher interest rates) in unusual circumstances.concerns have also been raised about the european central bank's effectiveness in addressing the recent surge in energy prices. some experts suggest that the eurozone should be viewed as a small open economy, implying that changes in its demand may not significantly impact global prices. moreover, they argue that monetary policy might have minimal influence on the global demand for energy. this is because household demand for essentials like heating and transportation is believed to be relatively insensitive to price changes. additionally, while a stronger euro could theoretically lead to lower import prices, it's uncertain whether these savings would be effectively passed on to consumers. however, recent studies contradict these views by highlighting the significant role of energy prices in the transmission of monetary policy within the eurozone. an increase in the ecb's policy rates tends to appreciate the euro against the dollar. this appreciation can lead to higher local energy costs but may also reduce demand, potentially lowering global energy prices. these studies support the ecb's decision to follow the federal reserve's lead in raising policy rates, which appears to have been a strategic move to curb imported inflation and address the spike in energy prices. ==== effects of the monetary tightening ==== the implementing a of tighter monetary policy has emerged as the eurozone solution to fight the latest inflationary pressure. however, this approach bears the risk of hindering the progress of the economic revival post-covid. raising interest rates is a strategic move by the ecb with specific aims: to decelerate economic activity, stabilize inflation expectations, and steer towards lower inflation levels. studies have shown that as interest rates rise, the price on the world market does not really change. however, the euro becomes more attractive to investors, leading to its appreciation against other currencies. this change benefits households paying for gas in euros, as it translates into lower prices for dollar-traded oil.on the other hand, the increase in interest rates, while helping to suppress prices, also places strains on the manufacturing sector and the labor market. the aftermath of this shock sees tighter financing conditions and a dip in demand, resulting in a slight uptick in unemployment rates, going beyond 0.1 percentage points. although the study shows that manufacturing sector quickly rebounds, returning to its pre-shock state within about three months, the impact on unemployment rates lingers for a longer period. == mandate and inflation target == the ecb has one primary objective – price stability – subject to which it may pursue secondary objectives. === primary mandate === the primary objective of the european central bank, set out in article 127(1) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union, is to maintain price stability within the eurozone. however the eu treaties do not specify exactly how the ecb should pursue this objective. the european central bank has ample discretion over the way it pursues its price stability objective, as it can self-decide on the inflation target, and may also influence the way inflation is being measured. since 2021, the ecb has defined its objective as targeting an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term. before that, the precise formulation of the price stability objective has changed over the years: the governing council in october 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, \"a year-on-year increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices (hicp) for the euro area of below 2%\" and added that price stability \"was to be maintained over the medium term\". in may 2003, following a thorough review of the ecb's monetary policy strategy, the governing council clarified that \"in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term\". in 2016, the european central bank's president has further adjusted its communication, by introducing the notion of \"symmetry\" in its definition of its target, thus making it clear that the ecb should respond both to inflationary pressures and to deflationary pressures. as draghi once said \"symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently low inflation, but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2%.\"on 8 july 2021, as a result of the strategic review led by the new president christine lagarde, the ecb officially abandoned the \"below but close to two per cent\" definition and adopted instead a 2% symmetric target. === secondary mandate === without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the treaty (127 tfeu) also provides room for the ecb to pursue other objectives:without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the escb shall support the general economic policies in the union with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the union as laid down in article 3 of the treaty on european union.this legal provision is often considered to provide a \"secondary mandate\" to the ecb and offers ample justifications for the ecb to also prioritize other considerations such as full employment or environmental protection, which are mentioned in the article 3 of the treaty on the european union. at the same time, economists and commentators are often divided on whether and how the ecb should pursue those secondary objectives, in particular the environmental impact. ecb official have also frequently pointed out the possible contradictions between those secondary objectives. to better guide the ecb's action on its secondary objectives, it has been suggested that closer consultation with the european parliament would be warranted. in 2023, the ecb recognised the possible role of the european parliament in the prioritisation of its secondary objectives. === tasks === to carry out its main mission, the ecb's tasks include: defining and implementing monetary policy managing foreign exchange operations maintaining the payment system to promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the target2 payments system and being currently developed technical platform for the settlement of securities in europe (target2 securities). consultative role: by law, the ecb's opinion is required on any national or eu legislation that falls within the ecb's competence. collection and establishment of statistics international cooperation issuing banknotes: the ecb holds the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. member states can issue euro coins, but the amount must be authorised by the ecb beforehand (upon the introduction of the euro, the ecb also had exclusive right to issue coins). financial stability and prudential policy banking supervision: since 2013, the ecb has been put in charge of supervising systemically relevant banks. === monetary policy tools === the principal monetary policy tool of the european central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements. the collateral used by the ecb is typically high quality public and private sector debt.all lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by article 18 of the statute of the escb.the criteria for determining \"high quality\" for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the european union: total debt must not be too large in relation to a gross domestic product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large. though these criteria are fairly simple, a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency—or the lack of the same. === difference with us federal reserve === in the united states federal reserve bank, the federal reserve buys assets: typically, bonds issued by the federal government. there is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as commercial paper. the purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for the functioning of the financial system.the eurosystem, on the other hand, uses collateralized lending as a default instrument. there are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term repo contracts. the difference is that banks in effect borrow cash from the ecb and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. when the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. an increase in the number of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. a decrease has the contrary effect. the contracts are carried on the asset side of the european central bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. in layman's terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.to qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. these can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted. the fairly stringent membership requirements for the european union, especially with regard to sovereign debt as a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, are designed to ensure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation. == organization == the ecb has four decision-making bodies, that take all the decisions with the objective of fulfilling the ecb's mandate: the executive board, the governing council, the general council, and the supervisory board. === decision-making bodies === ==== executive board ==== the executive board is responsible for the implementation of monetary policy (defined by the governing council) and the day-to-day running of the bank. it can issue decisions to national central banks and may also exercise powers delegated to it by the governing council. executive board members are assigned a portfolio of responsibilities by the president of the ecb. the executive board normally meets every tuesday. it is composed of the president of the bank (currently christine lagarde), the vice-president (currently luis de guindos) and four other members. they are all appointed by the european council for non-renewable terms of eight years. members of the executive board of the ecb are appointed \"from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by common accord of the governments of the member states at the level of heads of state or government, on a recommendation from the council, after it has consulted the european parliament and the governing council of the ecb\".josé manuel gonzález-páramo, a spanish member of the executive board since june 2004, was due to leave the board in early june 2012, but no replacement had been named as of late may. the spanish had nominated barcelona-born antonio sáinz de vicuña – an ecb veteran who heads its legal department – as gonzález-páramo's replacement as early as january 2012, but alternatives from luxembourg, finland, and slovenia were put forward and no decision made by may. after a long political battle and delays due to the european parliament's protest over the lack of gender balance at the ecb, luxembourg's yves mersch was appointed as gonzález-páramo's replacement.in december 2020, frank elderson succeeded to yves mersch at the ecb's board. ==== governing council ==== the governing council is the main decision-making body of the eurosystem. it comprises the members of the executive board (six in total) and the governors of the national central banks of the euro area countries (20 as of 2023). according to article 284 of the tfeu, the president of the european council and a representative from the european commission may attend the meetings as observers, but they lack voting rights. since january 2015, the ecb has published on its website a summary of the governing council deliberations (\"accounts\"). these publications came as a partial response to recurring criticism against the ecb's opacity. however, in contrast to other central banks, the ecb still does not disclose individual voting records of the governors seating in its council. ==== general council ==== the general council is a body dealing with transitional issues of euro adoption, for example, fixing the exchange rates of currencies being replaced by the euro (continuing the tasks of the former emi). it will continue to exist until all eu member states adopt the euro, at which point it will be dissolved. it is composed of the president and vice-president together with the governors of all of the eu's national central banks. ==== supervisory board ==== the ecb supervisory board meets twice a month to discuss, plan and carry out the ecb's supervisory tasks. it proposes draft decisions to the governing council under the non-objection procedure. it is composed of chair (appointed for a non-renewable term of five years), vice-chair (chosen from among the members of the ecb's executive board) four ecb representatives and representatives of national supervisors. if the national supervisory authority designated by a member state is not a national central bank (ncb), the representative of the competent authority can be accompanied by a representative from their ncb. in such cases, the representatives are together considered as one member for the purposes of the voting procedure.it also includes the steering committee, which supports the activities of the supervisory board and prepares the board's meetings. it is composed by the chair of the supervisory board, vice-chair of the supervisory board, one ecb representative and five representatives of national supervisors. the five representatives of national supervisors are appointed by the supervisory board for one year based on a rotation system that ensures a fair representation of countries. === capital subscription === the ecb is governed by european law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ecb has shareholders and stock capital. its initial capital was supposed to be €5 billion and the initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the member states' populations and gdp, but the key is adjustable. the euro area ncbs were required to pay their respective subscriptions to the ecb's capital in full. the ncbs of the non-participating countries have had to pay 7% of their respective subscriptions to the ecb's capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ecb. as a result, the ecb was endowed with an initial capital of just under €4 billion. the capital is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. shares in the ecb are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral. the ncbs are the sole subscribers to and holders of the capital of the ecb. today, ecb capital is about €11 billion, which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. the ncbs' shares in this capital are calculated using a capital key which reflects the respective member's share in the total population and gross domestic product of the eu. the ecb adjusts the shares every five years and whenever the number of contributing ncbs changes. the adjustment is made on the basis of data provided by the european commission. all national central banks (ncbs) that own a share of the ecb capital stock as of 1 february 2020 are listed below. non-euro area ncbs are required to pay up only a very small percentage of their subscribed capital, which accounts for the different magnitudes of euro area and non-euro area total paid-up capital. === reserves === in addition to capital subscriptions, the ncbs of the member states participating in the euro area provided the ecb with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around €40 billion. the contributions of each ncb is in proportion to its share in the ecb's subscribed capital, while in return each ncb is credited by the ecb with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution. 15% of the contributions was made in gold, and the remaining 85% in us dollars and uk pounds sterling. === languages === the internal working language of the ecb is english, and press conferences are held in english. external communications are handled flexibly: english is preferred (though not exclusively) for communication within the escb (i.e. with other central banks) and with financial markets; communication with other national bodies and with eu citizens is normally in their respective language, but the ecb website is predominantly english; official documents such as the annual report are in the official languages of the eu (generally english, german and french).in 2022, the ecb publishes for the first time details on the nationality of its staff, revealing an over-representation of germans and italians along the ecb employees, including in management positions. === independence === the european central bank (and by extension, the eurosystem) is often considered as the \"most independent central bank in the world\". in general terms, this means that the eurosystem tasks and policies can be discussed, designed, decided and implemented in full autonomy, without pressure or need for instructions from any external body. the main justification for the ecb's independence is that such an institutional setup assists the maintenance of price stability.in practice, the ecb's independence is pinned by four key principles: operational and legal independence: the ecb has all required competences to achieve its price stability mandate and thereby can steer monetary policy in full autonomy and by means of high level of discretion. the ecb's governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy, since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public (leading to suspicions that governing council members are voting along national lines.) in addition to monetary policy decisions, the ecb has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable union regulations. the ecb's own legal personality also allows the ecb to enter into international legal agreements independently from other eu institutions, and be the party of legal proceedings. finally, the ecb can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. personal independence: the mandate of ecb board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years. in addition, ecb board members are vastly immune from judicial proceedings. indeed, removals from the office can only be decided by the court of justice of the european union (cjeu), under the request of the ecb's governing council or the executive board (i.e. the ecb itself). such a decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. national governors of the eurosystem's national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with a possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct. financial independence: the ecb is the only body within the eu whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. the ecb uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. the ecb's financial independence reinforces its political independence. because the ecb does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct monetary financing of public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities. political independence: the community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ecb or of the ncbs in the performance of their tasks. symmetrically, eu institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ecb's independence. it is the latter which is the subject of much debate. === democratic accountability === in return to its high degree of independence and discretion, the ecb is accountable to the european parliament (and to a lesser extent to the european court of auditors, the european ombudsman and the court of justice of the eu (cjeu)). although the accountability mechanisms are not enshrined in eu law, several practices were established following a resolution of the european parliament adopted in 1998, which were informally agreed by the ecb, and incorporated into the parliament's rule of procedure. in 2023, the european parliament and the ecb made these accountability arrangements were made more formal by signing an exchange of letter.the accountability framework involves five main mechanisms: annual report: the ecb is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the european parliament, the european commission, the council of the european union and the european council . the report is presented to the european parliament at the occasion of a specific hearing with the ecb's vice-president at the econ committee. annual parliamentary resolution: in return, the european parliament evaluates the past activities to the ecb via its own annual resolution on the european central bank's report (which is essentially a non-legally-binding list of resolutions). since 2016, the ecb replies to the parliament's suggestions in an annex to its annual report. quarterly hearings (known as the \"monetary dialogue\"): the economic and monetary affairs committee of the european parliament organises a hearing with the ecb every quarter, allowing members of parliament to address oral questions to the ecb president. parliamentary questions: all members of the european parliament have the right to address written questions to the ecb president. the ecb president provides a written answer in about six weeks. appointments: the european parliament is consulted during the appointment process of executive board members of the ecb. however the parliament's vote is only consultative, and in practice, the parliament's opinion – when negative – has been ignored by the european council. legal proceedings: the ecb's legal personality allows civil society or public institutions to file complaints against the ecb to the court of justice of the eu.in 2013, an interinstitutional agreement was reached between the ecb and the european parliament in the context of the establishment of the ecb's banking supervision. this agreement sets broader powers to the european parliament than the established practice on the monetary policy side of the ecb's activities. for example, under the agreement, the parliament can veto the appointment of the chair and vice-chair of the ecb's supervisory board and may approve removals if requested by the ecb. === transparency === in addition to its independence, the ecb is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to eu institutions standards and other major central banks. indeed, as pointed out by transparency international, \"the treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the eu and its institutions. they do, however, grant the ecb a partial exemption from these principles. according to art. 15(3) tfeu, the ecb is bound by the eu's transparency principles \"only when exercising [its] administrative tasks\" (the exemption – which leaves the term \"administrative tasks\" undefined – equally applies to the court of justice of the european union and to the european investment bank).\"in practice, there are several concrete examples where the ecb is less transparent than other institutions: voting secrecy: while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers, the ecb's governing council decisions are made in full discretion. since 2014, the ecb has published \"accounts\" of its monetary policy meetings, but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes. access to documents: the obligation for eu bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ecb. however, under the ecb's rules of procedure, the governing council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30 years. disclosure of securities: the ecb is less transparent than the fed when it comes to disclosing the list of securities being held in its balance sheet under monetary policy operations such as qe. == location == the bank is based in ostend (east end), frankfurt am main. the city is the largest financial centre in the eurozone and the bank's location in it is fixed by the amsterdam treaty. the bank moved to a new purpose-built headquarters in 2014, designed by a vienna-based architectural office, coop himmelbau. the building is approximately 180 metres (591 ft) tall and is to be accompanied by other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of frankfurt am main. the main construction on a 120,000 m2 total site area began in october 2008, and it was expected that the building would become an architectural symbol for europe. while it was designed to accommodate double the number of staff who operated in the former eurotower, that building has been retained by the ecb, owing to more space being required since it took responsibility for banking supervision. == debates surrounding the ecb == === debates on ecb independence === the debate on the independence of the ecb finds its origins in the preparatory stages of the construction of the emu. the german government agreed to go ahead if certain crucial guarantees were respected, such as a european central bank independent of national governments and shielded from political pressure along the lines of the german central bank. the french government, for its part, feared that this independence would mean that politicians would no longer have any room for manoeuvre in the process. a compromise was then reached by establishing a regular dialogue between the ecb and the council of finance ministers of the euro area, the eurogroupe. ==== arguments in favour of independence ==== there is strong consensus among economists on the value of central bank independence from politics. the rationale behind are both empirical and theoretical. on the theoretical side, it's believed that time inconsistency suggests the existence of political business cycles where elected officials might take advantage of policy surprises to secure reelection. the politician up to the election will therefore be incentivized to introduce expansionary monetary policies, reducing unemployment in the short run. these effects will be most likely temporary. by contrast, in the long run, it will increase inflation, with unemployment returning to the natural rate negating the positive effect. furthermore, the credibility of the central bank will deteriorate, making it more difficult to answer the market. additionally, empirical work has been done that defined and measured central bank independence (cbi), looking at the relationship of cbi with inflation. ==== the arguments against too much independence ==== ===== an independence that would be the source of a democratic deficit. ===== demystify the independence of central bankers: according to christopher adolph (2009), the alleged neutrality of central bankers is only a legal façade and not an indisputable fact. to achieve this, the author analyses the professional careers of central bankers and mirrors them with their respective monetary decision-making. to explain the results of his analysis, he utilizes he uses the \"principal-agent\" theory. to explain that in order to create a new entity, one needs a delegator or principal (in this case the heads of state or government of the euro area) and a delegate or agent (in this case the ecb). in his illustration, he describes the financial community as a \"shadow principale\" which influences the choice of central bankers thus indicating that the central banks indeed act as interfaces between the financial world and the states. it is therefore not surprising, still according to the author, to regain their influence and preferences in the appointment of central bankers, presumed conservative, neutral and impartial according to the model of the independent central bank (icb), which eliminates this famous \"temporal inconsistency\". central bankers had a professional life before joining the central bank and their careers will most likely continue after their tenure. they are ultimately human beings. therefore, for the author, central bankers have interests of their own, based on their past careers and their expectations after joining the ecb, and try to send messages to their future potential employers. the crisis: an opportunity to impose its will and extend its powers: – its participation in the troika: thanks to its three factors which explain its independence, the ecb took advantage of this crisis to implement, through its participation in the troika, the famous structural reforms in the member states aimed at making, more flexible the various markets, particularly the labour market, which are still considered too rigid under the ordoliberal concept.- macro-prudential supervision : at the same time, taking advantage of the reform of the financial supervision system, the frankfurt bank has acquired new responsibilities, such as macro-prudential supervision, in other words, supervision of the provision of financial services.-take liberties with its mandate to save the euro : paradoxically, the crisis undermined the ecb's ordoliberal discourse \"because some of its instruments, which it had to implement, deviated significantly from its principles. it then interpreted the paradigm with enough flexibly to adapt its original reputation to these new economic conditions. it was forced to do so as a last resort to save its one and only raison d'être: the euro. this independent was thus obliged to be pragmatic by departing from the spirit of its statutes, which is unacceptable to the hardest supporters of ordoliberalism, which will lead to the resignation of the two german leaders present within the ecb: the governor of the bundesbank, jens weidmann and the member of the executive board of the ecb, jürgen stark.– regulation of the financial system : the delegation of this new function to the ecb was carried out with great simplicity and with the consent of european leaders, because neither the commission nor the member states really wanted to obtain the monitoring of financial abuses throughout the area. in other words, in the event of a new financial crisis, the ecb would be the perfect scapegoat.- capturing exchange rate policy : the event that will most mark the definitive politicization of the ecb is, of course, the operation launched in january 2015: the quantitative easing (qe) operation. indeed, the euro is an overvalued currency on the world markets against the dollar and the euro zone is at risk of deflation. in addition, member states find themselves heavily indebted, partly due to the rescue of their national banks. the ecb, as the guardian of the stability of the euro zone, is deciding to gradually buy back more than eur 1 100 billion member states' public debt. in this way, money is injected back into the economy, the euro depreciates significantly, prices rise, the risk of deflation is removed, and member states reduce their debts. however, the ecb has just given itself the right to direct the exchange rate policy of the euro zone without this being granted by the treaties or with the approval of european leaders, and without public opinion or the public arena being aware of this.in conclusion, for those in favour of a framework for ecb independence, there is a clear concentration of powers. in the light of these facts, it is clear that the ecb is no longer the simple guardian of monetary stability in the euro area, but has become, over the course of the crisis, a \"multi-competent economic player, at ease in this role that no one, especially not the agnostic governments of the euro member states, seems to have the idea of challenging\". this new political super-actor, having captured many spheres of competence and a very strong influence in the economic field in the broad sense (economy, finance, budget...). this new political super-actor can no longer act alone and refuse a counter-power, consubstantial to our liberal democracies. indeed, the status of independence which the ecb enjoys by essence should not exempt it from a real responsibility regarding the democratic process. ===== the arguments in favour of a counter power ===== in the aftermath of the euro area crisis, several proposals for a countervailing power were put forward, to deal with criticisms of a democratic deficit. for the german economist german issing (2001) the ecb as a democratic responsibility and should be more transparent. according to him, this transparency could bring several advantages as the improvement of efficiency and credibility by giving the public adequate information. others think that the ecb should have a closer relationship with the european parliament which could play a major role in the evaluation of the democratic responsibility of the ecb. the development of new institutions or the creation of a minister is another solution proposed: a minister for the eurozone ? the idea of a eurozone finance minister is regularly raised and supported by certain political figures, including emmanuel macron, as well as former german chancellor angela merkel, former president of the ecb jean-claude trichet and former european commissioner pierre moscovici. for the latter, this position would bring \"more democratic legitimacy\" and \"more efficiency\" to european politics. in his view, it is a question of merging the powers of commissioner for the economy and finance with those of the president of the eurogroup.the main task of this minister would be to \"represent a strong political authority protecting the economic and budgetary interests of the euro area as a whole, and not the interests of individual member states\". according to the jacques delors institute, its competencies could be as follows: supervising the coordination of economic and budgetary policies enforcing the rules in case of infringement conducting negotiations in a crisis context contributing to cushioning regional shocks representing the euro area in international institutions and forafor jean-claude trichet, this minister could also rely on the eurogroup working group for the preparation and follow-up of meetings in eurozone format, and on the economic and financial committee for meetings concerning all member states. he would also have under his authority a general secretariat of the treasury of the euro area, whose tasks would be determined by the objectives of the budgetary union currently being set up this proposal was nevertheless rejected in 2017 by the eurogroup, its president, jeroen dijsselbloem, spoke of the importance of this institution in relation to the european commission.towards democratic institutions ? the absence of democratic institutions such as a parliament or a real government is a regular criticism of the ecb in its management of the euro area, and many proposals have been made in this respect, particularly after the economic crisis, which would have shown the need to improve the governance of the euro area. for moïse sidiropoulos, a professor in economy: \"the crisis in the euro zone came as no surprise, because the euro remains an unfinished currency, a stateless currency with a fragile political legitimacy\".french economist thomas piketty wrote on his blog in 2017 that it was essential to equip the eurozone with democratic institutions. an economic government could for example enable it to have a common budget, common taxes and borrowing and investment capacities. such a government would then make the euro area more democratic and transparent by avoiding the opacity of a council such as the eurogroup. nevertheless, according to him \"there is no point in talking about a government of the eurozone if we do not say to which democratic body this government will be accountable\", a real parliament of the eurozone to which a finance minister would be accountable seems to be the real priority for the economist, who also denounces the lack of action in this area.the creation of a sub-committee within the current european parliament was also mentioned, in the model of the eurogroup, which is currently an under-formation of the ecofin committee. this would require a simple amendment to the rules of procedure and would avoid a competitive situation between two separate parliamentary assemblies. the former president of the european commission had, moreover, stated on this subject that he had \"no sympathy for the idea of a specific eurozone parliament\". ==== debates on the role of central bank reserves in monetary policy ==== in \"towards monetary policies that do not subsidise banks\" published in july 2023 and co-authored with yuemei ji, paul de grauwe criticizes the prevailing role of central bank reserves in monetary policy. holding the john paulson chair in european political economy at the london school of economics, de grauwe presented his views on this matter in a lecture at the bundesbank in september 2023.de grauwe states that major central banks are currently operating in a regime of abundance of bank reserves. this abundance, he argues, is a consequence of massive government bond-buying programs and a fundamental change in the operating procedures of these central banks. since late 2021, in response to rising interest rates aimed at combating inflation, central banks have adopted a procedure of increasing interest rates by raising the remuneration on bank reserves. this approach has resulted in substantial interest payments to commercial banks. due to past quantitative easing, bank reserves are now massive, leading to huge transfers of profits. paul de grauwe highlights the magnitude of these interest payments, comparing them to significant public expenditures: the interests received by commercial banks to the yearly spending of the eu (€165 billion) to the interest payments of the ecb during the same period (€152 billion). de grauwe argues that these transfers lack economic rationale. despite seigniorage gains traditionally returning to the government, he observes that central banks are transferring more than the total seigniorage gains to private banks, resulting in significant losses and effectively constituting a subsidy to banks at the expense of taxpayers. furthermore, the author raises concerns about moral hazard, noting that the provision of free interest hedging for banks by central banks may create ethical issues, as public authorities offer free insurance to private agents. questioning the economic rationale for these practices, de grauwe states that the remuneration of bank reserves is not totally necessary for conducting monetary policy and that the regime of reserve abundance is a result of the oversupply of reserves created by central banks through the buying of large amounts of government bonds. now, central banks cannot raise the interest rate without remunerating bank reserves, the equilibrium of demand (commercial blanks) and supply (central banks) being under the 0% rate. de grauwe also states that the reserve abundance regime has altered the view of economists on the role of central banks : money base created by the central bank is now viewed as part of the public debt since central banks must pay a rate of remuneration on bank reserves. according to de grauwe, this view is not inevitable and he suggests alternative operating procedures to address these issues : a gradual return to a regime of scarce reserves through quantitative tightening, raising minimum reserve requirements without paying interest on bank reserves, and implementing a two-tier system of reserve requirements to control the market rate while reducing transfers to commercial banks. == see also == european banking authority european systemic risk board open market operation economic and monetary union capital markets union european banking union list of central banks == notes == == references == == external links == official website the human back, also called the dorsum (pl.: dorsa), is the large posterior area of the human body, rising from the top of the buttocks to the back of the neck. it is the surface of the body opposite from the chest and the abdomen. the vertebral column runs the length of the back and creates a central area of recession. the breadth of the back is created by the shoulders at the top and the pelvis at the bottom. back pain is a common medical condition, generally benign in origin. == structure == the central feature of the human back is the vertebral column, specifically the length from the top of the thoracic vertebrae to the bottom of the lumbar vertebrae, which houses the spinal cord in its spinal canal, and which generally has some curvature that gives shape to the back. the ribcage extends from the spine at the top of the back (with the top of the ribcage corresponding to the t1 vertebra), more than halfway down the length of the back, leaving an area with less protection between the bottom of the ribcage and the hips. the width of the back at the top is defined by the scapula, the broad, flat bones of the shoulders. === muscles === the muscles of the back can be divided into three distinct groups; a superficial group, an intermediate group and a deep group. ==== superficial group ==== the superficial group, also known as the appendicular group, is primarily associated with movement of the appendicular skeleton. it is composed of trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid major, rhomboid minor and levator scapulae. it is innervated by anterior rami of spinal nerves, reflecting its embryological origin outside the back. ==== intermediate group ==== the intermediate group is also known as respiratory group as it may serve a respiratory function. it is composed of serratus posterior superior and serratus posterior inferior. like the superficial group, it is innervated by anterior rami of spinal nerves. ==== deep group ==== the deep group, also known as the intrinsic group due to its embryological origin in the back, can be further subdivided into four groups: spinotransversales – composed of splenius capitis and splenius cervicis. erector spinae – composed of iliocostalis, longissismus and spinalis transversospinales – composed of semispinalis, multifidus and rotatores segmental muscles – composed of levatores costarum, interspinales and intertransversariithe deep group is innervated by the posterior rami of spinal nerves. === organs near the back === the lungs are within the ribcage, and extend to the back of the ribcage making it possible for them to be listened into through the back. the kidneys are situated beneath the muscles in the area below the end of the ribcage, loosely connected to the peritoneum. a strike to the lower back can damage the kidneys of the person being hit. === surface of the back === the skin of the human back is thicker and has fewer nerve endings than the skin on any other part of the torso. with some notable exceptions (see, e.g., george \"the animal\" steele), it tends to have less hair than the chest on men. the upper-middle back is also the one area of the body which a typical human under normal conditions might be unable to physically touch. the skin of the back is innervated by the dorsal cutaneous branches, as well as the lateral abdominal cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves. === movement === the intricate anatomy of the back provides support for the head and trunk of the body, strength in the trunk of the body, as well as a great deal of flexibility and movement. the upper back has the most structural support, with the ribs attached firmly to each level of the thoracic spine and very limited movement. the lower back (lumbar vertebrae) allows for flexibility and movement in back bending (extension) and forward bending (flexion). it does not permit twisting. == clinical significance == === back pain === the back comprises interconnecting nerves, bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons, all of which can be a source of pain. back pain is the second most common type of pain in adults (the most common being headaches). by far the most common cause of back pain is muscle strain. the back muscles can usually heal themselves within a couple of weeks, but the pain can be intense and debilitating. other common sources of back pain include disc problems, such as degenerative disc disease or a lumbar disc herniation, many types of fractures, such as spondylolisthesis or an osteoporotic fracture, or osteoarthritis. == society and culture == the curvature of the female back is a frequent theme in paintings, because the sensibilities of many cultures permit the back to be shown nude - implying full nudity without actually displaying it. indeed, the practice of showing explicitness on the lower back has been performed for centuries. certain articles of clothing, such as the haltertop and the backless dress, are designed to expose the back in this manner. the lower back is typically exposed frequently by many types of shirts in woman's fashion, and even the more conservative shirts and blouses will reveal the lower back. this happens for a variety of reasons- the lower waist area is a pivot point for the body and lengthens and arches as a person sits or bends. secondly, woman's fashion typically favors tops that are waist length, allowing the back to be left bare during slight movement, bending or sitting. the back also serves as the largest canvas for body art on the human body. because of its size and the relative lack of hair, the back presents an ideal canvas on the human body for lower back tattoos, mostly among young women. indeed, some individuals have tattoos that cover the entirety of the back. others have smaller tattoos at significant locations, such as the shoulder blade or the bottom of the back. the part of the back that typically cannot be reached to be scratched is sometimes named acnestis. an itch there can be irritant, leading to the development and use of backscratchers. many english idioms mention the back, usually highlighting it as an area of vulnerability; one must \"watch one's back\", or one may end up \"with one's back up against the wall\"; worse yet, someone may \"stab one in the back\", but hopefully a friend \"has got one's back\". \"wetback\" is a derogatory name in american english for immigrants who cross the us-mexico border illegally (purportedly swimming though the rio grande). the back is also a symbol of strength and hard work, with those seeking physical labor looking for \"strong backs\", and workers being implored to \"put their back into it\". historically, flagellation of a person across the back with a whip was both a common form of punishment of criminals, and a common means of forcing slaves to work. as well, self-flagellation, as in self punishment, may include the use of whipping oneself. this is one method of mortification, the practice of inflicting physical suffering on oneself with the religious belief that it will serve as penance for one's own sins or those of others. while more moderate forms of mortification are widely practiced—particularly in the catholic church—self flagellation is not encouraged by mainstream religions or religious leaders. a well-known instrument used for flagellations is the infamous cat 'o nine tails, a nine-corded whip with one handle enabling a much more effective whipping than would be possible with only one lashing at a time. == references == the international monetary fund (imf) is a major financial agency of the united nations, and an international financial institution funded by 190 member countries, with headquarters in washington, d.c. it is regarded as the global lender of last resort to national governments, and a leading supporter of exchange-rate stability. its stated mission is \"working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.\" established on december 27, 1945 at the bretton woods conference, primarily according to the ideas of harry dexter white and john maynard keynes, it started with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international monetary system after world war ii. it now plays a central role in the management of balance of payments difficulties and international financial crises. through a quota system, countries contribute funds to a pool from which countries can borrow if they experience balance of payments problems. as of 2016, the fund had sdr 477 billion (about us$667 billion).the imf works to stabilize and foster the economies of its member countries by its use of the fund, as well as other activities such as gathering and analyzing economic statistics and surveillance of its members' economies. imf funds come from two major sources: quotas and loans. quotas, which are pooled funds from member nations, generate most imf funds. the size of members' quotas increase according to their economic and financial importance in the world. the quotas are increased periodically as a means of boosting the imf's resources in the form of special drawing rights.the current managing director (md) and chairwoman of the imf is bulgarian economist kristalina georgieva, who has held the post since october 1, 2019. indian-american economist gita gopinath, previously the chief economist, was appointed as first deputy managing director, effective january 21, 2022. pierre-olivier gourinchas was appointed chief economist on january 24, 2022. == functions == according to the imf itself, it works to foster global growth and economic stability by providing policy advice and financing the members by working with developing countries to help them achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty. the rationale for this is that private international capital markets function imperfectly and many countries have limited access to financial markets. such market imperfections, together with balance-of-payments financing, provide the justification for official financing, without which many countries could only correct large external payment imbalances through measures with adverse economic consequences. the imf provides alternate sources of financing such as the poverty reduction and growth facility.upon the founding of the imf, its three primary functions were: to oversee the fixed exchange rate arrangements between countries, thus helping national governments manage their exchange rates and allowing these governments to prioritize economic growth, and to provide short-term capital to aid the balance of payments and prevent the spread of international economic crises. to help mend the pieces of the international economy after the great depression and world war ii as well as to provide capital investments for economic growth and projects such as infrastructure.the imf's role was fundamentally altered by the floating exchange rates after 1971. it shifted to examining the economic policies of countries with imf loan agreements to determine whether a shortage of capital was due to economic fluctuations or economic policy. the imf also researched what types of government policy would ensure economic recovery. a particular concern of the imf was to prevent financial crises, such as those in mexico in 1982, brazil in 1987, east asia in 1997–98, and russia in 1998, from spreading and threatening the entire global financial and currency system. the challenge was to promote and implement a policy that reduced the frequency of crises among emerging market countries, especially the middle-income countries which are vulnerable to massive capital outflows. rather than maintaining a position of oversight of only exchange rates, their function became one of surveillance of the overall macroeconomic performance of member countries. their role became a lot more active because the imf now manages economic policy rather than just exchange rates.in addition, the imf negotiates conditions on lending and loans under their policy of conditionality, which was established in the 1950s. low-income countries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of time with no interest rates, through the extended credit facility (ecf), the standby credit facility (scf) and the rapid credit facility (rcf). non-concessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through the stand-by arrangements (sba), the flexible credit line (fcl), the precautionary and liquidity line (pll), and the extended fund facility. the imf provides emergency assistance via the rapid financing instrument (rfi) to members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs. === surveillance of the global economy === the imf is mandated to oversee the international monetary and financial system and monitor the economic and financial policies of its member countries. this activity is known as surveillance and facilitates international co-operation. since the demise of the bretton woods system of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s, surveillance has evolved largely by way of changes in procedures rather than through the adoption of new obligations. the responsibilities changed from those of guardians to those of overseers of members' policies.the fund typically analyses the appropriateness of each member country's economic and financial policies for achieving orderly economic growth, and assesses the consequences of these policies for other countries and for the global economy. for instance, the imf played a significant role in individual countries, such as armenia and belarus, in providing financial support to achieve stabilization financing from 2009 to 2019. the maximum sustainable debt level of a polity, which is watched closely by the imf, was defined in 2011 by imf economists to be 120%. indeed, it was at this number that the greek economy melted down in 2010. in 1995, the international monetary fund began to work on data dissemination standards with the view of guiding imf member countries to disseminate their economic and financial data to the public. the international monetary and financial committee (imfc) endorsed the guidelines for the dissemination standards and they were split into two tiers: the general data dissemination system (gdds) and the special data dissemination standard (sdds).the executive board approved the sdds and gdds in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and subsequent amendments were published in a revised guide to the general data dissemination system. the system is aimed primarily at statisticians and aims to improve many aspects of statistical systems in a country. it is also part of the world bank millennium development goals (mdg) and poverty reduction strategic papers (prsps).the primary objective of the gdds is to encourage member countries to build a framework to improve data quality and statistical capacity building to evaluate statistical needs, set priorities in improving timeliness, transparency, reliability, and accessibility of financial and economic data. some countries initially used the gdds, but later upgraded to sdds.some entities that are not imf members also contribute statistical data to the systems: palestinian authority – gdds hong kong – sdds macau – gdds institutions of the european union: the european central bank for the eurozone – sdds eurostat for the whole eu – sdds, thus providing data from cyprus (not using any ddsystem on its own) and malta (using only gdds on its own)a 2021 study found that the imf's surveillance activities have \"a substantial impact on sovereign debt with much greater impacts in emerging than high-income economies\". === world economic outlook === world economic outlook is a survey, published twice a year, by international monetary fund staff, which analyzes the global economy in the near and medium term. === conditionality of loans === imf conditionality is a set of policies or conditions that the imf requires in exchange for financial resources. the imf does require collateral from countries for loans but also requires the government seeking assistance to correct its macroeconomic imbalances in the form of policy reform. if the conditions are not met, the funds are withheld. the concept of conditionality was introduced in a 1952 executive board decision and later incorporated into the articles of agreement. conditionality is associated with economic theory as well as an enforcement mechanism for repayment. stemming primarily from the work of jacques polak, the theoretical underpinning of conditionality was the \"monetary approach to the balance of payments\". ==== structural adjustment ==== some of the conditions for structural adjustment can include: cutting expenditures or raising revenues, also known as austerity. focusing economic output on direct export and resource extraction, devaluation of currencies, trade liberalisation, or lifting import and export restrictions, increasing the stability of investment (by supplementing foreign direct investment with the opening of facilities for the domestic market), balancing budgets and not overspending, removing price controls and state subsidies, privatization, or divestiture of all or part of state-owned enterprises, enhancing the rights of foreign investors vis-a-vis national laws, improving governance and fighting corruption,these conditions are known as the washington consensus. ==== benefits ==== these loan conditions ensure that the borrowing country will be able to repay the imf and that the country will not attempt to solve their balance-of-payment problems in a way that would negatively impact the international economy. the incentive problem of moral hazard—when economic agents maximise their own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of imf loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.conditionality also reassures the imf that the funds lent to them will be used for the purposes defined by the articles of agreement and provides safeguards that the country will be able to rectify its macroeconomic and structural imbalances. in the judgment of the imf, the adoption by the member of certain corrective measures or policies will allow it to repay the imf, thereby ensuring that the resources will be available to support other members.as of 2004, borrowing countries have had a good track record for repaying credit extended under the imf's regular lending facilities with full interest over the duration of the loan. this indicates that imf lending does not impose a burden on creditor countries, as lending countries receive market-rate interest on most of their quota subscription, plus any of their own-currency subscriptions that are loaned out by the imf, plus all of the reserve assets that they provide the imf. == history == === 20th century === the imf was originally laid out as a part of the bretton woods system exchange agreement in 1944. during the great depression, countries sharply raised barriers to trade in an attempt to improve their failing economies. this led to the devaluation of national currencies and a decline in world trade.this breakdown in international monetary cooperation created a need for oversight. the representatives of 45 governments met at the bretton woods conference in the mount washington hotel in bretton woods, new hampshire, in the united states, to discuss a framework for postwar international economic cooperation and how to rebuild europe. there were two views on the role the imf should assume as a global economic institution. american delegate harry dexter white foresaw an imf that functioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay their debts on time. most of white's plan was incorporated into the final acts adopted at bretton woods. british economist john maynard keynes, on the other hand, imagined that the imf would be a cooperative fund upon which member states could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through periodic crises. this view suggested an imf that helped governments and act as the united states government had during the new deal to the great depression of the 1930s.the imf formally came into existence on 27 december 1945, when the first 29 countries ratified its articles of agreement. by the end of 1946 the imf had grown to 39 members. on 1 march 1947, the imf began its financial operations, and on 8 may france became the first country to borrow from it.the imf was one of the key organizations of the international economic system; its design allowed the system to balance the rebuilding of international capitalism with the maximization of national economic sovereignty and human welfare, also known as embedded liberalism. the imf's influence in the global economy steadily increased as it accumulated more members. its membership began to expand in the late 1950s and during the 1960s as many african countries became independent and applied for membership. but the cold war limited the fund's membership, with most countries in the soviet sphere of influence not joining until 1970s and 1980s.the bretton woods exchange rate system prevailed until 1971 when the united states government suspended the convertibility of the us$ (and dollar reserves held by other governments) into gold. this is known as the nixon shock. the changes to the imf articles of agreement reflecting these changes were ratified in 1976 by the jamaica accords. later in the 1970s, large commercial banks began lending to states because they were awash in cash deposited by oil exporters. the lending of the so-called money center banks led to the imf changing its role in the 1980s after a world recession provoked a crisis that brought the imf back into global financial governance.in the mid-1980s, the imf shifted its narrow focus from currency stabilization to a broader focus of promoting market-liberalizing reforms through structural adjustment programs. this shift occurred without a formal renegotiation of the organization's charter or operational guidelines. the ronald reagan administration, in particular treasury secretary james baker, his assistant secretary david mulford and deputy assistant secretary charles dallara, pressured the imf to attach market-liberal reforms to the organization's conditional loans.during the 20th century, the imf shifted its position on capital controls. whereas the imf permitted capital controls at its founding and throughout the 1970s, imf staff increasingly favored free capital movement from 1980s onwards. this shift happened in the aftermath of an emerging consensus in economics on the desirability of free capital movement, retirement of imf staff hired in the 1940s and 1950s, and the recruitment of staff exposed to new thinking in economics. === 21st century === the imf provided two major lending packages in the early 2000s to argentina (during the 1998–2002 argentine great depression) and uruguay (after the 2002 uruguay banking crisis). however, by the mid-2000s, imf lending was at its lowest share of world gdp since the 1970s.in may 2010, the imf participated, in 3:11 proportion, in the first greek bailout that totaled €110 billion, to address the great accumulation of public debt, caused by continuing large public sector deficits. as part of the bailout, the greek government agreed to adopt austerity measures that would reduce the deficit from 11% in 2009 to \"well below 3%\" in 2014. the bailout did not include debt restructuring measures such as a haircut, to the chagrin of the swiss, brazilian, indian, russian, and argentinian directors of the imf, with the greek authorities themselves (at the time, pm george papandreou and finance minister giorgos papakonstantinou) ruling out a haircut.a second bailout package of more than €100 billion was agreed upon over the course of a few months from october 2011, during which time papandreou was forced from office. the so-called troika, of which the imf is part, are joint managers of this programme, which was approved by the executive directors of the imf on 15 march 2012 for xdr 23.8 billion and saw private bondholders take a haircut of upwards of 50%. in the interval between may 2010 and february 2012 the private banks of holland, france, and germany reduced exposure to greek debt from €122 billion to €66 billion.as of january 2012, the largest borrowers from the imf in order were greece, portugal, ireland, romania, and ukraine.on 25 march 2013, a €10 billion international bailout of cyprus was agreed by the troika, at the cost to the cypriots of its agreement: to close the country's second-largest bank; to impose a one-time bank deposit levy on bank of cyprus uninsured deposits. no insured deposit of €100k or less were to be affected under the terms of a novel bail-in scheme.the topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by the imf in april 2013, for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"sovereign debt restructuring: recent developments and implications for the fund's legal and policy framework\". the paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 may, summarised the recent experiences in greece, st kitts and nevis, belize, and jamaica. an explanatory interview with deputy director hugh bredenkamp was published a few days later, as was a deconstruction by matina stevis of the wall street journal.in the october 2013, fiscal monitor publication, the imf suggested that a capital levy capable of reducing euro-area government debt ratios to \"end-2007 levels\" would require a very high tax rate of about 10%.the fiscal affairs department of the imf, headed at the time by acting director sanjeev gupta, produced a january 2014 report entitled \"fiscal policy and income inequality\" that stated that \"some taxes levied on wealth, especially on immovable property, are also an option for economies seeking more progressive taxation ... property taxes are equitable and efficient, but underutilized in many economies ... there is considerable scope to exploit this tax more fully, both as a revenue source and as a redistributive instrument.\"at the end of march 2014, the imf secured an $18 billion bailout fund for the provisional government of ukraine in the aftermath of the revolution of dignity. ==== response and analysis of coronavirus ==== in late 2019, the imf estimated global growth in 2020 to reach 3.4%, but due to the coronavirus, in november 2020, it expected the global economy to shrink by 4.4%.in march 2020, kristalina georgieva announced that the imf stood ready to mobilize $1 trillion as its response to the covid-19 pandemic. this was in addition to the $50 billion fund it had announced two weeks earlier, of which $5 billion had already been requested by iran. one day earlier on 11 march, the uk called to pledge £150 million to the imf catastrophe relief fund. it came to light on 27 march that \"more than 80 poor and middle-income countries\" had sought a bailout due to the coronavirus.on 13 april 2020, the imf said that it \"would provide immediate debt relief to 25 member countries under its catastrophe containment and relief trust (ccrt)\" programme. == member countries == not all member countries of the imf are sovereign states, and therefore not all \"member countries\" of the imf are members of the united nations. amidst \"member countries\" of the imf that are not member states of the un are non-sovereign areas with special jurisdictions that are officially under the sovereignty of full un member states, such as aruba, curaçao, hong kong, and macao, as well as kosovo. the corporate members appoint ex-officio voting members, who are listed below. all members of the imf are also international bank for reconstruction and development (ibrd) members and vice versa.former members are cuba (which left in 1964), and taiwan, which was ejected from the imf in 1980 after losing the support of the then united states president jimmy carter and was replaced by the people's republic of china. however, \"taiwan province of china\" is still listed in the official imf indices.apart from cuba, the other un states that do not belong to the imf are liechtenstein, monaco and north korea. however, andorra became the 190th member on 16 october 2020.poland withdrew in 1950—allegedly pressured by the soviet union—but returned in 1986. the former czechoslovakia was expelled in 1954 for \"failing to provide required data\" and was readmitted in 1990, after the velvet revolution. === qualifications === any country may apply to be a part of the imf. post-imf formation, in the early postwar period, rules for imf membership were left relatively loose. members needed to make periodic membership payments towards their quota, to refrain from currency restrictions unless granted imf permission, to abide by the code of conduct in the imf articles of agreement, and to provide national economic information. however, stricter rules were imposed on governments that applied to the imf for funding.the countries that joined the imf between 1945 and 1971 agreed to keep their exchange rates secured at rates that could be adjusted only to correct a \"fundamental disequilibrium\" in the balance of payments, and only with the imf's agreement. === benefits === member countries of the imf have access to information on the economic policies of all member countries, the opportunity to influence other members' economic policies, technical assistance in banking, fiscal affairs, and exchange matters, financial support in times of payment difficulties, and increased opportunities for trade and investment. == personnel == === board of governors === the board of governors consists of one governor and one alternate governor for each member country. each member country appoints its two governors. the board normally meets once a year and is responsible for electing or appointing an executive director to the executive board. while the board of governors is officially responsible for approving quota increases, special drawing right allocations, the admittance of new members, compulsory withdrawal of members, and amendments to the articles of agreement and by-laws, in practice it has delegated most of its powers to the imf's executive board.the board of governors is advised by the international monetary and financial committee and the development committee. the international monetary and financial committee has 24 members and monitors developments in global liquidity and the transfer of resources to developing countries. the development committee has 25 members and advises on critical development issues and on financial resources required to promote economic development in developing countries. the board of governors reports directly to the managing director of the imf, kristalina georgieva. === executive board === 24 executive directors make up the executive board. the executive directors represent all 189 member countries in a geographically based roster. countries with large economies have their own executive director, but most countries are grouped in constituencies representing four or more countries.following the 2008 amendment on voice and participation which came into effect in march 2011, seven countries each appoint an executive director: the united states, japan, china, germany, france, the united kingdom, and saudi arabia. the remaining 17 directors represent constituencies consisting of 2 to 23 countries. this board usually meets several times each week. the board membership and constituency is scheduled for periodic review every eight years. === managing director === the imf is led by a managing director, who is head of the staff and serves as chairman of the executive board. the managing director is the most powerful position at the imf. historically, the imf's managing director has been a european citizen and the president of the world bank has been an american citizen. however, this standard is increasingly being questioned and competition for these two posts may soon open up to include other qualified candidates from any part of the world. in august 2019, the international monetary fund has removed the age limit which is 65 or over for its managing director position.in 2011, the world's largest developing countries, the bric states, issued a statement declaring that the tradition of appointing a european as managing director undermined the legitimacy of the imf and called for the appointment to be merit-based. ==== list of managing directors ==== former managing director dominique strauss-kahn was arrested in connection with charges of sexually assaulting a new york hotel room attendant and resigned on 18 may. the charges were later dropped. on 28 june 2011 christine lagarde was confirmed as managing director of the imf for a five-year term starting on 5 july 2011. she was re-elected by consensus for a second five-year term, starting 5 july 2016, being the only candidate nominated for the post of managing director. === first deputy managing director === the managing director is assisted by a first deputy managing director (fdmd) who, by convention, has always been a citizen of the united states. together, the managing director and their first deputy lead the senior management of the imf. like the managing director, the first deputy traditionally serves a five-year term. ==== list of first deputy managing directors ==== === chief economist === the chief economist leads the research division of the imf and is a \"senior official\" of the imf. ==== list of chief economists ==== === imf staff === imf staff have considerable autonomy and are known to shape imf policy. according to jeffrey chwieroth, \"it is the staff members who conduct the bulk of the imf's tasks; they formulate policy proposals for consideration by member states, exercise surveillance, carry out loan negotiations and design the programs, and collect and systematize detailed information.\" most imf staff are economists. according to a 1968 study, nearly 60% of staff were from english-speaking developed countries. by 2004, between 40 and 50% of staff were from english-speaking developed countries.a 1996 study found that 90% of new staff with a phd obtained them from universities in the united states or canada. a 1999 study found that none of the new staff with a phd obtained their phd in the global south. == voting power == voting power in the imf is based on a quota system. each member has a number of basic votes, equal to 5.502% of the total votes, plus one additional vote for each special drawing right (sdr) of 100,000 of a member country's quota. the sdr is the unit of account of the imf and represents a potential claim to currency. it is based on a basket of key international currencies. the basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small countries, but the additional votes determined by sdr outweigh this bias. changes in the voting shares require approval by a super-majority of 85% of voting power. in december 2015, the united states congress adopted a legislation authorising the 2010 quota and governance reforms. as a result, all 190 members' quotas will increase from a total of about xdr 238.5 billion to about xdr 477 billion, while the quota shares and voting power of the imf's poorest member countries will be protected. more than 6 percent of quota shares will shift to dynamic emerging market and developing countries and also from over-represented to under-represented members. four emerging market countries (brazil, china, india, and russia) will be among the ten largest members of the imf. other top 10 members are the united states, japan, germany, france, the united kingdom and italy. === effects of the quota system === the imf's quota system was created to raise funds for loans. each imf member country is assigned a quota, or contribution, that reflects the country's relative size in the global economy. each member's quota also determines its relative voting power. thus, financial contributions from member governments are linked to voting power in the organization.this system follows the logic of a shareholder-controlled organization: wealthy countries have more say in the making and revision of rules. since decision making at the imf reflects each member's relative economic position in the world, wealthier countries that provide more money to the imf have more influence than poorer members that contribute less; nonetheless, the imf focuses on redistribution. === inflexibility of voting power === quotas are normally reviewed every five years and can be increased when deemed necessary by the board of governors. imf voting shares are relatively inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-represented as their voting power lags behind. currently, reforming the representation of developing countries within the imf has been suggested. these countries' economies represent a large portion of the global economic system but this is not reflected in the imf's decision-making process through the nature of the quota system. joseph stiglitz argues, \"there is a need to provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries, which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since 1944, when the imf was created.\" in 2008, a number of quota reforms were passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries. === overcoming borrower/creditor divide === the imf's membership is divided along income lines: certain countries provide financial resources while others use these resources. both developed country \"creditors\" and developing country \"borrowers\" are members of the imf. the developed countries provide the financial resources but rarely enter into imf loan agreements; they are the creditors. conversely, the developing countries use the lending services but contribute little to the pool of money available to lend because their quotas are smaller; they are the borrowers. thus, tension is created around governance issues because these two groups, creditors and borrowers, have fundamentally different interests.the criticism is that the system of voting power distribution through a quota system institutionalizes borrower subordination and creditor dominance. the resulting division of the imf's membership into borrowers and non-borrowers has increased the controversy around conditionality because the borrowers are interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain reassurance that the loans will be repaid. == use == a recent source revealed that the average overall use of imf credit per decade increased, in real terms, by 21% between the 1970s and 1980s, and increased again by just over 22% from the 1980s to the 1991–2005 period. another study has suggested that since 1950 the continent of africa alone has received $300 billion from the imf, the world bank, and affiliate institutions.a study by bumba mukherjee found that developing democratic countries benefit more from imf programs than developing autocratic countries because policy-making, and the process of deciding where loaned money is used, is more transparent within a democracy. one study done by randall stone found that although earlier studies found little impact of imf programs on balance of payments, more recent studies using more sophisticated methods and larger samples \"usually found imf programs improved the balance of payments\". === exceptional access framework – sovereign debt === the exceptional access framework was created in 2003 when john b. taylor was under secretary of the us treasury for international affairs. the new framework became fully operational in february 2003 and it was applied in the subsequent decisions on argentina and brazil. its purpose was to place some sensible rules and limits on the way the imf makes loans to support governments with debt problem—especially in emerging markets—and thereby move away from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. such a reform was essential for ending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets. the reform was closely related to and put in place nearly simultaneously with the actions of several emerging market countries to place collective action clauses in their bond contracts. in 2010, the framework was abandoned so the imf could make loans to greece in an unsustainable and political situation.the topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by imf staff in april 2013 for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"sovereign debt restructuring: recent developments and implications for the fund's legal and policy framework\". the paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 may, summarised the recent experiences in greece, st kitts and nevis, belize, and jamaica. an explanatory interview with deputy director hugh bredenkamp was published a few days later, as was a deconstruction by matina stevis of the wall street journal.the staff was directed to formulate an updated policy, which was accomplished on 22 may 2014 with a report entitled \"the fund's lending framework and sovereign debt: preliminary considerations\", and taken up by the executive board on 13 june. the staff proposed that \"in circumstances where a (sovereign) member has lost market access and debt is considered sustainable ... the imf would be able to provide exceptional access on the basis of a debt operation that involves an extension of maturities\", which was labeled a \"reprofiling operation\". these reprofiling operations would \"generally be less costly to the debtor and creditors—and thus to the system overall—relative to either an upfront debt reduction operation or a bail-out that is followed by debt reduction ... (and) would be envisaged only when both (a) a member has lost market access and (b) debt is assessed to be sustainable, but not with high probability ... creditors will only agree if they understand that such an amendment is necessary to avoid a worse outcome: namely, a default and/or an operation involving debt reduction ... collective action clauses, which now exist in most—but not all—bonds would be relied upon to address collective action problems.\" == impact == according to a 2002 study by randall w. stone, the academic literature on the imf shows \"no consensus on the long-term effects of imf programs on growth\".some research has found that imf loans can reduce the chance of a future banking crisis, while other studies have found that they can increase the risk of political crises. imf programs can reduce the effects of a currency crisis.some research has found that imf programs are less effective in countries which possess a developed-country patron (be it by foreign aid, membership of postcolonial institutions or un voting patterns), seemingly due to this patron allowing countries to flaunt imf program rules as these rules are not consistently enforced. some research has found that imf loans reduce economic growth due to creating an economic moral hazard, reducing public investment, reducing incentives to create a robust domestic policies and reducing private investor confidence. other research has indicated that imf loans can have a positive impact on economic growth and that their effects are highly nuanced. == criticisms == overseas development institute (odi) research undertaken in 1980 included criticisms of the imf which support the analysis that it is a pillar of what activist titus alexander calls global apartheid. developed countries were seen to have a more dominant role and control over less developed countries (ldcs). the fund worked on the incorrect assumption that all payments disequilibria were caused domestically. the group of 24 (g-24), on behalf of ldc members, and the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad) complained that the imf did not distinguish sufficiently between disequilibria with predominantly external as opposed to internal causes. this criticism was voiced in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. then ldcs found themselves with payment deficits due to adverse changes in their terms of trade, with the fund prescribing stabilization programmes similar to those suggested for deficits caused by government over-spending. faced with long-term, externally generated disequilibria, the g-24 argued for more time for ldcs to adjust their economies. some imf policies may be anti-developmental; the report said that deflationary effects of imf programmes quickly led to losses of output and employment in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high. moreover, the burden of the deflation is disproportionately borne by the poor. the imf's initial policies were based in theory and influenced by differing opinions and departmental rivalries. critics suggest that its intentions to implement these policies in countries with widely varying economic circumstances were misinformed and lacked economic rationale.odi conclusions were that the imf's very nature of promoting market-oriented approaches attracted unavoidable criticism. on the other hand, the imf could serve as a scapegoat while allowing governments to blame international bankers. the odi conceded that the imf was insensitive to political aspirations of ldcs while its policy conditions were inflexible.argentina, which had been considered by the imf to be a model country in its compliance to policy proposals by the bretton woods institutions, experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to have been caused by imf-induced budget restrictions—which undercut the government's ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health, education, and security—and privatisation of strategically vital national resources. others attribute the crisis to argentina's misdesigned fiscal federalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly. the crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in argentina and other south american countries, with many blaming the imf for the region's economic problems. the current—as of early 2006—trend toward moderate left-wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic policy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this crisis.in 2006, a senior actionaid policy analyst akanksha marphatia stated that imf policies in africa undermine any possibility of meeting the millennium development goals (mdgs) due to imposed restrictions that prevent spending on important sectors, such as education and health.in an interview (2008-05-19), the former romanian prime minister călin popescu-tăriceanu claimed that \"since 2005, imf is constantly making mistakes when it appreciates the country's economic performances\". former tanzanian president julius nyerere, who claimed that debt-ridden african states were ceding sovereignty to the imf and the world bank, famously asked, \"who elected the imf to be the ministry of finance for every country in the world?\"former chief economist of imf and former reserve bank of india (rbi) governor raghuram rajan who predicted the financial crisis of 2007–08 criticised the imf for remaining a sideline player to the developed world. he criticised the imf for praising the monetary policies of the us, which he believed were wreaking havoc in emerging markets. he had been critical of \"ultra-loose money policies\" of some unnamed countries.countries such as zambia have not received proper aid with long-lasting effects, leading to concern from economists. since 2005, zambia (as well as 29 other african countries) did receive debt write-offs, which helped with the country's medical and education funds. however, zambia returned to a debt of over half its gdp in less than a decade. american economist william easterly, sceptical of the imf's methods, had initially warned that \"debt relief would simply encourage more reckless borrowing by crooked governments unless it was accompanied by reforms to speed up economic growth and improve governance\", according to the economist. === conditionality === the imf has been criticised for being \"out of touch\" with local economic conditions, cultures, and environments in the countries they are requiring policy reform. the economic advice the imf gives might not always take into consideration the difference between what spending means on paper and how it is felt by citizens. countries charge that with excessive conditionality, they do not \"own\" the programmes and the links are broken between a recipient country's people, its government, and the goals being pursued by the imf.jeffrey sachs argues that the imf's \"usual prescription is 'budgetary belt tightening to countries who are much too poor to own belts'\". sachs wrote that the imf's role as a generalist institution specialising in macroeconomic issues needs reform. conditionality has also been criticised because a country can pledge collateral of \"acceptable assets\" to obtain waivers—if one assumes that all countries are able to provide \"acceptable collateral\".one view is that conditionality undermines domestic political institutions. the recipient governments are sacrificing policy autonomy in exchange for funds, which can lead to public resentment of the local leadership for accepting and enforcing the imf conditions. political instability can result from more leadership turnover as political leaders are replaced in electoral backlashes. imf conditions are often criticised for reducing government services, thus increasing unemployment.another criticism is that imf policies are only designed to address poor governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention in markets, and too much state ownership. this assumes that this narrow range of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised and differing contexts are ignored. a country may also be compelled to accept conditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial crisis in need of assistance.on top of that, regardless of what methodologies and data sets used, it comes to same the conclusion of exacerbating income inequality. with gini coefficient, it became clear that countries with imf policies face increased income inequality.it is claimed that conditionalities retard social stability and hence inhibit the stated goals of the imf, while structural adjustment programmes lead to an increase in poverty in recipient countries. the imf sometimes advocates \"austerity programmes\", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when the economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing budget deficits. countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax rate. in globalization and its discontents, joseph e. stiglitz, former chief economist and senior vice-president at the world bank, criticises these policies. he argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out keynesian reflations, and that the imf \"was not participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the western financial community.\"stiglitz concludes, \"modern high-tech warfare is designed to remove physical contact: dropping bombs from 50,000 feet ensures that one does not 'feel' what one does. modern economic management is similar: from one's luxury hotel, one can callously impose policies about which one would think twice if one knew the people whose lives one was destroying.\"the researchers eric toussaint and damien millet argue that the imf's policies amount to a new form of colonisation that does not need a military presence: following the exigencies of the governments of the richest companies, the imf, permitted countries in crisis to borrow in order to avoid default on their repayments. caught in the debt's downward spiral, developing countries soon had no other recourse than to take on new debt in order to repay the old debt. before providing them with new loans, at higher interest rates, future leaders asked the imf, to intervene with the guarantee of ulterior reimbursement, asking for a signed agreement with the said countries. the imf thus agreed to restart the flow of the 'finance pump' on condition that the concerned countries first use this money to reimburse banks and other private lenders, while restructuring their economy at the imf's discretion: these were the famous conditionalities, detailed in the structural adjustment programmes. the imf and its ultra-liberal experts took control of the borrowing countries' economic policies. a new form of colonisation was thus instituted. it was not even necessary to establish an administrative or military presence; the debt alone maintained this new form of submission. international politics play an important role in imf decision making. the clout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to imf finances. the united states has the greatest number of votes and therefore wields the most influence. domestic politics often come into play, with politicians in developing countries using conditionality to gain leverage over the opposition to influence policy.in 2016, the imf's research department published a report titled \"neoliberalism: oversold?\" which, while praising some aspects of the \"neoliberal agenda\", claims that the organisation has been \"overselling\" fiscal austerity policies and financial deregulation, which they claim has exacerbated both financial crises and economic inequality around the world.in 2020 and 2021, oxfam criticized the imf for forcing tough austerity measures on many low income countries during the covid-19 pandemic, despite forcing cuts to healthcare spending, would hamper the recipient's response to the pandemic. === support of dictatorships === the role of the bretton woods institutions has been controversial since the late cold war, because of claims that the imf policy makers supported military dictatorships friendly to american and european corporations, but also other anti-communist and communist regimes (such as mobutu's zaire and ceaușescu's romania, respectively). critics also claim that the imf is generally apathetic or hostile to human rights, and labour rights. the controversy has helped spark the anti-globalization movement. an example of imf's support for a dictatorship was its ongoing support for mobutu's rule in zaire, although its own envoy, erwin blumenthal, provided a sobering report about the entrenched corruption and embezzlement and the inability of the country to pay back any loans.arguments in favour of the imf say that economic stability is a precursor to democracy; however, critics highlight various examples in which democratised countries fell after receiving imf loans.a 2017 study found no evidence of imf lending programs undermining democracy in borrowing countries. to the contrary, it found \"evidence for modest but definitively positive conditional differences in the democracy scores of participating and non-participating countries\".on 28 june 2021, the imf approved a us$1 billion loan to the ugandan government despite protests from ugandans in washington, london and south africa. === impact on access to food === a number of civil society organisations have criticised the imf's policies for their impact on access to food, particularly in developing countries. in october 2008, former united states president bill clinton delivered a speech to the united nations on world food day, criticising the world bank and imf for their policies on food and agriculture: we need the world bank, the imf, all the big foundations, and all the governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including me when i was president. we were wrong to believe that food was like some other product in international trade, and we all have to go back to a more responsible and sustainable form of agriculture. the fpif remarked that there is a recurring pattern: \"the destabilization of peasant producers by a one-two punch of imf-world bank structural adjustment programs that gutted government investment in the countryside followed by the massive influx of subsidized u.s. and european union agricultural imports after the wto's agreement on agriculture pried open markets.\" === impact on public health === a 2009 study concluded that the strict conditions resulted in thousands of deaths in eastern europe by tuberculosis as public health care had to be weakened. in the 21 countries to which the imf had given loans, tuberculosis deaths rose by 16.6%. a 2017 systematic review on studies conducted on the impact that structural adjustment programs have on child and maternal health found that these programs have a detrimental effect on maternal and child health among other adverse effects. === reform === ==== function and policies ==== the imf is only one of many international organisations, and it is a generalist institution that deals only with macroeconomic issues; its core areas of concern in developing countries are very narrow. one proposed reform is a movement towards close partnership with other specialist agencies such as unicef, the food and agriculture organization (fao), and the united nations development program (undp).jeffrey sachs argues in the end of poverty that the imf and the world bank have \"the brightest economists and the lead in advising poor countries on how to break out of poverty, but the problem is development economics\". development economics needs the reform, not the imf. he also notes that imf loan conditions should be paired with other reforms—e.g., trade reform in developed nations, debt cancellation, and increased financial assistance for investments in basic infrastructure. imf loan conditions cannot stand alone and produce change; they need to be partnered with other reforms or other conditions as applicable. ==== u.s. influence and voting reform ==== the scholarly consensus is that imf decision-making is not simply technocratic, but also guided by political and economic concerns. the united states is the imf's most powerful member, and its influence reaches even into decision-making concerning individual loan agreements. the u.s. has historically been openly opposed to losing what treasury secretary jacob lew described in 2015 as its \"leadership role\" at the imf, and the u.s.' \"ability to shape international norms and practices\".emerging markets were not well-represented for most of the imf's history: despite being the most populous country, china's vote share was the sixth largest; brazil's vote share was smaller than belgium's. reforms to give more powers to emerging economies were agreed by the g20 in 2010. the reforms could not pass, however, until they were ratified by the united states congress, since 85% of the fund's voting power was required for the reforms to take effect, and the americans held more than 16% of voting power at the time. after repeated criticism, the u.s. finally ratified the voting reforms at the end of 2015. the oecd countries maintained their overwhelming majority of voting share, and the u.s. in particular retained its share at over 16%.the criticism of the american- and european-dominated imf has led to what some consider \"disenfranchising the world\" from the governance of the imf. raúl prebisch, the founding secretary-general of the un conference on trade and development (unctad), wrote that one of \"the conspicuous deficiencies of the general economic theory, from the point of view of the periphery, is its false sense of universality\". == imf and globalization == globalization encompasses three institutions: global financial markets and transnational companies, national governments linked to each other in economic and military alliances led by the united states, and rising \"global governments\" such as world trade organization (wto), imf, and world bank. charles derber argues in his book people before profit, \"these interacting institutions create a new global power system where sovereignty is globalized, taking power and constitutional authority away from nations and giving it to global markets and international bodies\". titus alexander argues that this system institutionalises global inequality between western countries and the majority world in a form of global apartheid, in which the imf is a key pillar.the establishment of globalised economic institutions has been both a symptom of and a stimulus for globalisation. the development of the world bank, the imf, regional development banks such as the european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd), and multilateral trade institutions such as the wto signals a move away from the dominance of the state as the primary actor analysed in international affairs. globalization has thus been transformative in terms of limiting of state sovereignty over the economy. === international central bank digital currency === in april 2023, the imf launched their international central bank digital currency through their digital currency monetary authority, it will be called the universal monetary unit, or units for shorthand. the ansi character will be ü and will be used to facilitate international banking and international trade between countries and currencies. it will help facilitate swift transactions on cross border transactions at wholesale fx rates instantaneously with real-time settlements. in june, it announced it was working on a platform for central bank digital currencies (cbdcs) that would enable transctions between nations. imf managing director kristalina georgieva said that if central banks did not agree on a common platform, cryptocurrencies would fill the resulting vacuum. == scandals == managing director lagarde (2011–2019) was convicted of giving preferential treatment to businessman-turned-politician bernard tapie as he pursued a legal challenge against the french government. at the time, lagarde was the french economic minister. within hours of her conviction, in which she escaped any punishment, the fund's 24-member executive board put to rest any speculation that she might have to resign, praising her \"outstanding leadership\" and the \"wide respect\" she commands around the world.former imf managing director rodrigo rato was arrested in 2015 for alleged fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. in 2017, the audiencia nacional found rato guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to 4+1⁄2 years' imprisonment. in 2018, the sentence was confirmed by the supreme court of spain. == alternatives == in march 2011, the ministers of economy and finance of the african union proposed to establish an african monetary fund.at the 6th brics summit in july 2014 the brics nations (brazil, russia, india, china, and south africa) announced the brics contingent reserve arrangement (cra) with an initial size of us$100 billion, a framework to provide liquidity through currency swaps in response to actual or potential short-term balance-of-payments pressures.in 2014, the china-led asian infrastructure investment bank was established. == in the media == life and debt, a documentary film, deals with the imf's policies' influence on jamaica and its economy from a critical point of view. debtocracy, a 2011 independent greek documentary film, also criticises the imf. portuguese musician josé mário branco's 1982 album fmi is inspired by the imf's intervention in portugal through monitored stabilisation programs in 1977–78. in the 2015 film our brand is crisis, the imf is mentioned as a point of political contention, where the bolivian population fears its electoral interference. == see also == == notes == == references == === footnotes === ===

this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach. players on the batting team who reach first base without being called \"out\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. the fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. the pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base. the opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. one turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. a game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played. baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time. baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in england by the mid-18th century. this game was brought by immigrants to north america, where the modern version developed. baseball's american origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in american history such as the american civil war and the great depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of \"america's pastime\"; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the united states, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as american football. in addition to north america, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of central and south america, the caribbean, and east asia, particularly in japan, south korea, and taiwan. in major league baseball (mlb), the highest level of professional baseball in the united states and canada, teams are divided into the national league (nl) and american league (al), each with three divisions: east, west, and central. the mlb champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the world series. the top level of play is similarly split in japan between the central and pacific leagues and in cuba between the west league and east league. the world baseball classic, organized by the world baseball softball confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world. baseball was played at the olympic games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated in 2020. == rules and gameplay == a baseball game is played between two teams, each usually composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). a pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning. a game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college, minor league baseball and, since the 2020 season, major league baseball; and six innings at the little league level). one team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. the other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. the goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. the players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond. a player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, counterclockwise, from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. the team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. when three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. if the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.the game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. the 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. the part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. in the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. the outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. the fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.there are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt: the baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference. it has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching. the bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood. other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games. it is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob. bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (110 centimeters). the glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers. as an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.at the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. one of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. the pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. another fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. the rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. in the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. the basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. with the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered. a neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. other umpires will be distributed around the field as well. play starts with a member of the batting team, the batter, standing in either of the two batter's boxes next to home plate, holding a bat. the batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat. the catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. a batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). a batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base. a batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. a player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. a player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. if a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. if the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or if the batter-runner otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. this is the most desirable result for the batter. the ultimate and most desirable result possible for a batter would be to hit a home run while all three bases are occupied or \"loaded\", thus scoring four runs on a single hit. this is called a grand slam. a player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. a runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play, as only one runner may occupy a base at any given time. if a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. if the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.a pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. a batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. a batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (a batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee. any pitch which does not pass through the strike zone is called a ball, unless the batter either swings and misses at the pitch, or hits the pitch into foul territory; an exception generally occurs if the ball is hit into foul territory when the batter already has two strikes, in which case neither a ball nor a strike is called. while the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. in addition to the strikeout and flyout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the ground out, force out, and tag out. these occur either when a runner is forced to advance to a base, and a fielder with possession of the ball reaches that base before the runner does, or the runner is touched by the ball, held in a fielder's hand, while not on a base. (the batter-runner is always forced to advance to first base, and any other runners must advance to the next base if a teammate is forced to advance to their base.) it is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play. this is called a double play. three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. a runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.an individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate. on rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base). a batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. a runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the batting order. the batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game. children's games often have more lenient rules, such as little league rules, which allow players to be substituted back into the same game.if the designated hitter (dh) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). the dh takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. thus, even with the dh, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players. == personnel == === players === the number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play. a major league baseball (mlb) team has a roster of 26 players with specific roles. a typical roster features the following players: eight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular basis five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation seven relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up) one backup, or substitute, catcher five backup infielders and backup outfielders, or players who can play multiple positions, known as utility players.most baseball leagues worldwide have the dh rule, including mlb, japan's pacific league, and caribbean professional leagues, along with major american amateur organizations. the central league in japan does not have the rule and high-level minor league clubs connected to national league teams are not required to field a dh. in leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has nine offensive regulars (including the dh), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and two or three other reserve players. === managers and coaches === the manager, or head coach, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. at most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, who occupy designated coaches' boxes, just outside the foul lines. these coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play. in contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game. === umpires === any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. at a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. in mlb, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. in the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines. == strategy == many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers. a manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. during the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions. the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups and the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. with a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder (known as a defensive substitution). == tactics == === pitching and fielding === the tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection. by gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter, thus creating differing pitches that can be selected. among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical or horizontal location. if there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. with a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity. if an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. with a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield. === batting and baserunning === several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. the hit and run is sometimes employed, with a skillful contact hitter, the runner takes off with the pitch, drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through. the sacrifice bunt, calls for the batter to focus on making soft contact with the ball, so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position as the batter is thrown out at first. a batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit. a sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. with a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. in order to increase the chance of advancing a batter to first base via a walk, the manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch. the batter's potential reward of reaching base (via a walk) exceeds the disadvantage if the next pitch is a strike. == history == the evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision. consensus once held that today's baseball is a north american development from the older game rounders, popular among children in great britain and ireland. american baseball historian david block suggests that the game originated in england; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the english games of stoolball and \"tut-ball\". the earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 british publication, a little pretty pocket-book, by john newbery. block discovered that the first recorded game of \"bass-ball\" took place in 1749 in surrey, and featured the prince of wales as a player. this early form of the game was apparently brought to canada by english immigrants.by the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around north america. the first officially recorded baseball game in north america was played in beachville, ontario, canada, on june 4, 1838. in 1845, alexander cartwright, a member of new york city's knickerbocker club, led the codification of the so-called knickerbocker rules, which in turn were based on rules developed in 1837 by william r. wheaton of the gotham club. while there are reports that the new york knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in u.s. history took place on june 19, 1846, in hoboken, new jersey: the \"new york nine\" defeated the knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. with the knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century. by the time of the civil war, baseball had begun to overtake its fellow bat-and-ball sport cricket in popularity within the united states, due in part to baseball being of a much shorter duration than the form of cricket played at the time, as well as the fact that troops during the civil war did not need a specialized playing surface to play baseball, as they would have required for cricket. === in the united states === ==== establishment of professional leagues ==== in the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the new york metropolitan area, and by 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the \"national pastime\" or \"national game\". a year later, the sport's first governing body, the national association of base ball players, was formed. in 1867, it barred participation by african americans. the more formally structured national league was founded in 1876. professional negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. in 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game. the national league's first successful counterpart, the american league, which evolved from the minor western league, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by then.the national agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the national association of professional base ball leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues. the world series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall. the black sox scandal of the 1919 world series led to the formation of the office of the commissioner of baseball. the first commissioner, kenesaw mountain landis, was elected in 1920. that year also saw the founding of the negro national league; the first significant negro league, it would operate until 1931. for part of the 1920s, it was joined by the eastern colored league. ==== rise of ruth and racial integration ==== compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant. the so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. strict new regulations governed the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. the rise of the legendary player babe ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. in the late 1920s and early 1930s, st. louis cardinals general manager branch rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system. a new negro national league was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the negro american league. the first elections to the national baseball hall of fame took place in 1936. in 1939, little league baseball was founded in pennsylvania. a large number of minor league teams disbanded when world war ii led to a player shortage. chicago cubs owner philip k. wrigley led the formation of the all-american girls professional baseball league to help keep the game in the public eye. the first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred in 1945: jackie robinson was signed by the national league's brooklyn dodgers and began playing for their minor league team in montreal. in 1947, robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the dodgers. latin-american players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. in 1951, two chicago white sox, venezuelan-born chico carrasquel and black cuban-born minnie miñoso, became the first hispanic all-stars. integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster. ==== attendance records and the age of steroids ==== in 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system. significant work stoppages occurred in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the world series for the first time in 90 years. attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance. after play resumed in 1995, non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set. in 2000, the national and american leagues were dissolved as legal entities. while their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of mlb.in 2001, barry bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. there had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. in 2007, bonds became mlb's all-time home run leader, surpassing hank aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs. === around the world === with the historic popular moniker as \"america's national pastime\", baseball is well-established in several other countries as well. as early as 1877, a professional league, the international association, featured teams from both canada and the united states. while baseball is widely played in canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the american major leagues did not include a canadian club until 1969, when the montreal expos joined the national league as an expansion team. in 1977, the expansion toronto blue jays joined the american league. in 1847, american soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in mexico at parque los berros in xalapa, veracruz. the first formal baseball league outside of the united states and canada was founded in 1878 in cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition. the dominican republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the netherlands (formed in 1922), australia (1934), japan (1936), mexico (1937), and puerto rico (1938). the japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the united states. after world war ii, professional leagues were founded in many latin american countries, most prominently venezuela (1946) and the dominican republic (1955). since the early 1970s, the annual caribbean series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading latin american winter leagues: the dominican professional baseball league, mexican pacific league, puerto rican professional baseball league, and venezuelan professional baseball league. in asia, south korea (1982), taiwan (1990) and china (2003) all have professional leagues.the english football club, aston villa, were the first british baseball champions winning the 1890 national league of baseball of great britain. the 2020 national champions were the london mets. other european countries have seen professional leagues; the most successful, other than the dutch league, is the italian league, founded in 1948. in 2004, australia won a surprise silver medal at the olympic games. the confédération européene de baseball (european baseball confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries. other competitions between national teams, such as the baseball world cup and the olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the international baseball federation (ibaf) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the international softball federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the world baseball softball confederation (wbsc). women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries.after being admitted to the olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 summer olympic games at the 2005 international olympic committee meeting. it remained part of the 2008 games. while the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was mlb's reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season. mlb initiated the world baseball classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. the inaugural classic, held in march 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of mlb participants. the baseball world cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded world baseball classic. == distinctive elements == baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. all of these sports use a clock, play is less individual, and the variation between playing fields is not as substantial or important. the comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports. === no clock to kill === in clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. in contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. at almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. whereas, in the case of multi-day test and first-class cricket, the possibility of a draw (which occurs because of the restrictions on time, which like in baseball, originally did not exist) often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.while nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. at the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. in the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. by 1997, the average american league game lasted 2:57 (national league games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). in 2004, major league baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. by 2014, though, the average mlb game took over three hours to complete. the lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play, with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. other leagues have experienced similar issues. in 2008, nippon professional baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.in 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in major league baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. this was up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014. in response to the lengthening of the game, mlb decided from the 2023 season onward to institute a pitch clock rule to penalize batters and pitchers who take too much time between pitches; this had the effect of shortening 2023 regular season games by 24 minutes on average. === individual focus === although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. while rewarding, it has sometimes been described as \"ruthless\" due to the pressure on the individual player. in 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\". pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. while coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. if the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. the statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. there is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play. === uniqueness of parks === unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. while the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of mlb and minor league baseball, is that fields built or remodeled since june 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 feet (99 m) from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 feet (122 m) to center. major league teams often skirt even this rule. for example, at minute maid park, which became the home of the houston astros in 2000, the crawford boxes in left field are only 315 feet (96 m) from home plate. there are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. the most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at boston's fenway park, in use since 1912: the green monster is 310 feet (94 m) from home plate down the line and 37 feet (11 m) tall.similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. a fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. these variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. the surface of the field is also unregulated. while the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all mlb teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. some fields—including several in mlb—use artificial turf. surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. while football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. the area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant. these physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. a given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. the most exceptional park in this regard is coors field, home of the colorado rockies. its high altitude—5,282 feet (1,610 m) above sea level—is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure. wrigley field, home of the chicago cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a pitcher's park when the strong winds off lake michigan are blowing in, it becomes more of a hitter's park when they are blowing out. the absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. for example, hitting a fly ball 330 feet (100 m) into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. a team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the new york yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. on the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park. == statistics == organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. in the late 19th century, a former cricket player, english-born henry chadwick of brooklyn, was responsible for the \"development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\" the statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that chadwick came to be known as father baseball. in the 1920s, american newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian alan schwarz describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"the official baseball rules administered by mlb require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. the rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. the score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. general managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions. certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. the basic batting statistics include: at bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners hits: times a base is reached safely, because of a batted, fair ball without a fielding error or fielder's choice runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely runs batted in (rbis): number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting abilitythe basic baserunning statistics include: stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a basethe basic pitching statistics include: wins: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win) losses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished saves: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings innings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., \"5.2\" or \"7.1\", the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning) strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter winning percentage: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses) earned run average (era): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitchedthe basic fielding statistics include: putouts: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out assists: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball errors: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result total chances: putouts plus assists plus errors fielding average: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chancesamong the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. for example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. if a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed. === sabermetrics === sabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. the term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. the term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, bill james, and derives from the society for american baseball research (sabr).the growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average: on-base percentage (obp) measures a batter's ability to get on base. it is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts. slugging percentage (slg) measures a batter's ability to hit for power. it is calculated by taking the batter's total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use: on-base plus slugging (ops) measures a batter's overall ability. it is calculated by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage. walks plus hits per inning pitched (whip) measures a pitcher's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base. it is calculated by adding the number of walks and hits a pitcher surrendered, then dividing by the number of innings pitched. wins above replacement (war) measures number of additional wins his team has achieved above the number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a replacement-level player. == popularity and cultural impact == writing in 1919, philosopher morris raphael cohen described baseball as the national religion of the us. in the words of sports columnist jayson stark, baseball has long been \"a unique paragon of american culture\"—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal. baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: scholar peter bjarkman describes \"how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in japan.\" === in the united states === the major league game in the united states was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the national league's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. a century later, the situation was very different. with the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading american spectator sports. overall, baseball has a large following in the united states; a 2006 poll found that nearly half of americans are fans. in the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the united states moved in contradictory directions. in 2008, mlb set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the nfl's revenue for the first time in decades. a new mlb revenue record of more than $10 billion was set in 2017. on the other hand, the percentage of american sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 9%, compared to pro football at 37%. in 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. in 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year. the following year, amid the u.s. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million. eight years later, it dropped under 73 million. attendance at games held under the minor league baseball umbrella set a record in 2008, with 43.3 million. while mlb games have not drawn the same national tv viewership as football games, mlb games are dominant in teams' local markets and regularly lead all programs in primetime in their markets during the summer. === caribbean === since the early 1980s, the dominican republic, in particular the city of san pedro de macorís, has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent. in 2017, 83 of the 868 players on mlb opening day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country. among other caribbean countries and territories, a combined 97 mlb players were born in venezuela, cuba, and puerto rico. hall-of-famer roberto clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in puerto rico's history. while baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young puerto rican players began to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft. in cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues. === asia === in asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in japan and south korea. in japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in nippon professional baseball (npb), the body that oversees both the central and pacific leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. total npb attendance for the year was approximately 20 million. while in the preceding two decades, mlb attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable npb figures were stagnant. there are concerns that mlb's growing interest in acquiring star japanese players will hurt the game in their home country. revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system. similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport's governing authority \"has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes\". in taiwan, baseball is one of the most widely spectated sports, with the origins dating back to japanese rule. === among children === as of 2018, little league baseball oversees leagues with close to 2.4 million participants in over 80 countries. the number of players has fallen since the 1990s, when 3 million children took part in little league baseball annually. babe ruth league teams have over 1 million participants. according to the president of the international baseball federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including little league and the introductory game of tee ball.a varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the united states. in 2015, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 34,000 collegians played on their schools' baseball teams. by early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was japan's leading sport. today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. the final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the national high school baseball invitational tournament in the spring, and the even more important national high school baseball championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. the tournaments are known, respectively, as spring koshien and summer koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. in cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team. === in popular culture === baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the united states and elsewhere. dozens of english-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. the first networked radio broadcasts in north america were of the 1922 world series: famed sportswriter grantland rice announced play-by-play from new york city's polo grounds on wjz–newark, new jersey, which was connected by wire to wgy–schenectady, new york, and wbz–springfield, massachusetts. the baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the united states and japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the united kingdom.baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. one of the first major examples, ernest thayer's poem \"casey at the bat\", appeared in 1888. a wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a \"clutch situation\", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. there have been many baseball movies, including the academy award–winning the pride of the yankees (1942) and the oscar nominees the natural (1984) and field of dreams (1989). the american film institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes the pride of the yankees at number 3 and bull durham (1988) at number 5. baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the adler–ross musical damn yankees—and record—george j. gaskin's \"slide, kelly, slide\", simon and garfunkel's \"mrs. robinson\", and john fogerty's \"centerfield\". the baseball-inspired comedic sketch \"who's on first?\", popularized by abbott and costello in 1938, quickly became famous. six decades later, time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of ring lardner and novels such as bernard malamud's the natural (the source for the movie), robert coover's the universal baseball association, inc., j. henry waugh, prop., john grisham's calico joe and w. p. kinsella's shoeless joe (the source for field of dreams). baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of damon runyon; the columns of grantland rice, red smith, dick young, and peter gammons; and the essays of roger angell. among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are lawrence s. ritter's the glory of their times, roger kahn's the boys of summer, and michael lewis's moneyball. the 1970 publication of major league pitcher jim bouton's tell-all chronicle ball four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. a typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. in the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. the 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.modern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of rotisserie league baseball by new york writer daniel okrent and several friends. participants in a rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active mlb players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. the field boomed with increasing internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites. by 2008, 29.9 million people in the united states and canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby. the burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals. === derivative games === informal variations of baseball have popped up over time, with games like corkball reflecting local traditions and allowing the game to be played in diverse environments. two variations of baseball, softball and baseball5, are internationally governed alongside baseball by the world baseball softball confederation. ==== british baseball ==== american professional baseball teams toured britain in 1874 and 1889, and had a great effect on similar sports in britain. in wales and merseyside, a strong community game had already developed with skills and plays more in keeping with the american game and the welsh began to informally adopt the name \"baseball\" (pêl fas), to reflect the american style. by the 1890s, calls were made to follow the success of other working class sports (like rugby in wales and soccer in merseyside) and adopt a distinct set of rules and bureaucracy. during the 1892 season rules for the game of \"baseball\" were agreed and the game was officially codified. ==== finnish baseball ==== finnish baseball, also known as pesäpallo, is a combination of traditional ball-batting team games and north american baseball, invented by lauri \"tahko\" pihkala in the 1920s. the basic idea of pesäpallo is similar to that of baseball: the offense tries to score by hitting the ball successfully and running through the bases, while the defense tries to put the batter and runners out. one of the most important differences between pesäpallo and baseball is that the ball is pitched vertically, which makes hitting the ball, as well as controlling the power and direction of the hit, much easier. this gives the offensive game more variety, speed, and tactical aspects compared to baseball. == see also ==

american, july 13, 1878, p. 21 the marathon (from greek μαραθώνιος) is a long-distance foot race with a distance of 42.195 km (26 mi 385 yd), usually run as a road race, but the distance can be covered on trail routes. the marathon can be completed by running or with a run/walk strategy. there are also wheelchair divisions. more than 800 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.the marathon was one of the original modern olympic events in 1896. the distance did not become standardized until 1921. the distance is also included in the world athletics championships, which began in 1983. it is the only running road race included in both championship competitions (walking races on the roads are also contested in both). == history == === origin === the name marathon comes from the legend of pheidippides, the greek messenger. the legend states that, while he was taking part in the battle of marathon, which took place in august or september 490 bc, he witnessed a persian vessel changing its course towards athens as the battle was near a victorious end for the greek army. he interpreted this as an attempt by the defeated persians to rush into the city to claim a false victory or simply raid, hence claiming their authority over greek land. it was said that he ran the entire distance to athens without stopping, discarding his weapons and even clothes to lose as much weight as possible, and burst into the assembly, exclaiming \"we have won!\", before collapsing and dying.the account of the run from marathon to athens first appeared in plutarch's on the glory of athens in the first century ad, which quoted from heraclides ponticus's lost work, giving the runner's name as either thersipus of erchius or eucles. this was the account adopted by benjamin haydon for his painting eucles announcing the victory of marathon, published as an engraving in 1836 with a poetical illustration by letitia elizabeth landon. satirist lucian of samosata gave one of the earliest accounts similar to the modern version of the story, but its historical veracity is disputed based on its tongue-in-cheek writing and the runner being referred to as philippides and not pheidippides.there is debate about the historical accuracy of this legend. the greek historian herodotus, the main source for the greco-persian wars, mentioned philippides as the messenger who ran from athens to sparta asking for help, and then ran back, a distance of over 240 kilometres (150 mi) each way. in some herodotus manuscripts, the name of the runner between athens and sparta is given as philippides. herodotus makes no mention of a messenger sent from marathon to athens, and relates that the main part of the athenian army, having fought and won the grueling battle, and fearing a naval raid by the persian fleet against an undefended athens, marched quickly back from the battle to athens, arriving the same day. in 1879, robert browning wrote the poem pheidippides. browning's poem, his composite story, became part of late 19th century popular culture and was accepted as a historic legend.mount pentelicus stands between marathon and athens, which means that philippides would have had to run around the mountain, either to the north or to the south. the latter and more obvious route is followed by the modern marathon-athens highway (eo83–eo54), which follows the lay of the land southwards from marathon bay and along the coast, then takes a gentle but protracted climb westwards towards the eastern approach to athens, between the foothills of mounts hymettus and penteli, and then gently downhill to athens proper. this route, as it existed when the olympics were revived in 1896, was approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) long. it was the approximate distance originally used for marathon races. however, there have been suggestions that philippides might have followed another route: a westward climb along the eastern and northern slopes of mount penteli to the pass of dionysos, and then a straight southward downhill path to athens. this route is slightly shorter, 35 kilometres (22 mi), but includes a very steep climb over the first 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). === modern olympic marathon === when the modern olympics began in 1896, the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event, recalling the glory of ancient greece. the idea of a marathon race came from michel bréal, who wanted the event to feature in the first modern olympic games in 1896 in athens. this idea was heavily supported by pierre de coubertin, the founder of the modern olympics, as well as by the greeks. a selection race for the olympic marathon was held on 22 march 1896 (gregorian) that was won by charilaos vasilakos in 3 hours and 18 minutes. the winner of the first olympic marathon, on 10 april 1896 (a male-only race), was spyridon louis, a greek water-carrier, in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds. the marathon of the 2004 summer olympics was run on the traditional route from marathon to athens, ending at panathinaiko stadium, the venue for the 1896 summer olympics. that men's marathon was won by italian stefano baldini in 2 hours 10 minutes and 55 seconds, a record time for this route until the non-olympics athens classic marathon of 2014, when felix kandie lowered the course record to 2 hours 10 minutes and 37 seconds. the women's marathon was introduced at the 1984 summer olympics (los angeles, us) and was won by joan benoit of the united states with a time of 2 hours 24 minutes and 52 seconds.it has become a tradition for the men's olympic marathon to be the last event of the athletics calendar, on the final day of the olympics. for many years the race finished inside the olympic stadium; however, at the 2012 summer olympics (london), the start and finish were on the mall, and at the 2016 summer olympics (rio de janeiro), the start and finish were in the sambódromo, the parade area that serves as a spectator mall for carnival.often, the men's marathon medals are awarded during the closing ceremony (including the 2004 games, 2012 games and 2016 games). the olympic men's record is 2:06:32, set at the 2008 summer olympics by samuel kamau wanjiru of kenya. the olympic women's record is 2:23:07, set at the 2012 summer olympics by tiki gelana of ethiopia. the men's london 2012 summer olympic marathon winner was stephen kiprotich of uganda (2:08:01). per capita, the kalenjin ethnic group of rift valley province in kenya has produced a highly disproportionate share of marathon and track-and-field winners. === marathon mania === the boston marathon began on 19 april 1897, and was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 summer olympics. it is the world's oldest annual marathon, and ranks as one of the world's most prestigious road racing events. its course runs from hopkinton in southern middlesex county to copley square in boston. johnny hayes' victory at the 1908 summer olympics also contributed to the early growth of long-distance running and marathoning in the united states. later that year, races around the holiday season including the empire city marathon held on new year's day 1909 in yonkers, new york, marked the early running craze referred to as \"marathon mania\". following the 1908 olympics, the first five amateur marathons in new york city were held on days that held special meanings: thanksgiving day, the day after christmas, new year's day, washington's birthday, and lincoln's birthday.frank shorter's victory in the marathon at the 1972 summer olympics would spur national enthusiasm for the sport more intensely than that which followed hayes' win 64 years earlier. in 2014, an estimated 550,600 runners completed a marathon within the united states. this can be compared to 143,000 in 1980. today marathons are held all around the world on a nearly weekly basis. === inclusion of women === for a long time after the olympic marathon started, there were no long-distance races, such as the marathon, for women. although a few women, such as stamata revithi in 1896, had run the marathon distance, they were not included in any official results. marie-louise ledru has been credited as the first woman to complete a marathon, in 1918. violet piercy has been credited as the first woman to be officially timed in a marathon, in 1926.arlene pieper became the first woman to officially finish a marathon in the united states when she completed the pikes peak marathon in manitou springs, colorado, in 1959. kathrine switzer was the first woman to run the boston marathon \"officially\" (with a number), in 1967. however, switzer's entry, which was accepted through an \"oversight\" in the screening process, was in \"flagrant violation of the rules\", and she was treated as an interloper once the error was discovered. bobbi gibb had completed the boston race unofficially the previous year (1966), and was later recognized by the race organizers as the women's winner for that year, as well as 1967 and 1968. == distance == the length of an olympic marathon was not precisely fixed at first, but the marathon races in the first few olympic games were about 40 kilometres (25 mi), roughly the distance from marathon to athens by the longer, flatter route. the exact length depended on the route established for each venue. === 1908 olympics === the international olympic committee agreed in 1907 that the distance for the 1908 london olympic marathon would be about 25 miles or 40 kilometers. the organizers decided on a course of 26 miles from the start at windsor castle to the royal entrance to the white city stadium, followed by a lap (586 yards 2 feet; 536 m) of the track, finishing in front of the royal box. the course was later altered to use a different entrance to the stadium, followed by a partial lap of 385 yards to the same finish. the modern 42.195 km (26.219 mi) standard distance for the marathon was set by the international amateur athletic federation (iaaf) in may 1921 directly from the length used at the 1908 summer olympics in london. === iaaf and world records === an official iaaf marathon course is 42.195 km (42 m tolerance only in excess). course officials add a short course prevention factor of up to one meter per kilometer to their measurements to reduce the risk of a measuring error producing a length below the minimum distance. for events governed by iaaf rules, it is mandatory that the route be marked so that all competitors can see the distance covered in kilometers. the rules make no mention of the use of miles. the iaaf will only recognize world records that are established at events that are run under iaaf rules. for major events, it is customary to publish competitors' timings at the midway mark and also at 5 km splits; marathon runners can be credited with world records for lesser distances recognized by the iaaf (such as 20 km, 30 km and so on) if such records are established while the runner is running a marathon, and completes the marathon course. == marathon races == annually, more than 800 marathons are organized worldwide. some of these belong to the association of international marathons and distance races (aims) which has grown since its foundation in 1982 to embrace over 300 member events in 83 countries and territories. the marathons of berlin, boston, chicago, london, new york city and tokyo form the biennial world marathon majors series, awarding $500,000 annually to the best overall male and female performers in the series. in 2006, the editors of runner's world selected a \"world's top 10 marathons\", in which the amsterdam, honolulu, paris, rotterdam, and stockholm marathons were featured along with the five original world marathon majors events (excluding tokyo). other notable large marathons include united states marine corps marathon, los angeles, and rome. the boston marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon, inspired by the success of the 1896 olympic marathon and held every year since 1897 to celebrate patriots' day, a holiday marking the beginning of the american revolution, thereby purposely linking athenian and american struggle for democracy. the oldest annual marathon in europe is the košice peace marathon, held since 1924 in košice, slovakia. the historic polytechnic marathon was discontinued in 1996. the athens classic marathon traces the route of the 1896 olympic course, starting in marathon on the eastern coast of attica, site of the battle of marathon of 490 bc, and ending at the panathenaic stadium in athens. the midnight sun marathon is held in tromsø, norway at 70 degrees north. using unofficial and temporary courses, measured by gps, races of marathon distance are now held at the north pole, in antarctica and over desert terrain. other unusual marathons include the great wall marathon on the great wall of china, the big five marathon among the safari wildlife of south africa, the great tibetan marathon – a marathon in an atmosphere of tibetan buddhism at an altitude of 3,500 metres (11,500 ft), and the polar circle marathon on the permanent ice cap of greenland. a few marathons cross international and geographical borders. the istanbul marathon is the only marathon where participants run over two continents (europe and asia) during the course of a single event. in the detroit free press marathon, participants cross the us/canada border twice. the niagara falls international marathon includes one international border crossing, via the peace bridge from buffalo, new york, united states to fort erie, ontario, canada. in the three countries marathon, participants run through germany, switzerland and austria.on 20 march 2018, an indoor marathon took place in the armory in new york city. the 200 m track saw a world record in the women's and men's field. lindsey scherf (usa) set the indoor women's world record with 2:40:55. malcolm richards (usa) won in 2:19:01 with a male indoor world record. === wheelchair division === many marathons feature a wheelchair division. typically, those in the wheelchair racing division start their races earlier than their running counterparts. the first wheelchair marathon was in 1974 in toledo, ohio, won by bob hall in 2:54. hall competed in the 1975 boston marathon and finished in 2:58, inaugurating the introduction of wheelchair divisions into the boston marathon. from 1977 the race was declared the us national wheelchair championship. the boston marathon awards $10,000 to the winning push-rim athlete. ernst van dyk has won the boston marathon wheelchair division ten times and holds the world record at 1:18:27, set in boston in 2004. jean driscoll won eight times (seven consecutively) and holds the women's world record at 1:34:22.the new york city marathon banned wheelchair entrants in 1977, citing safety concerns, but then voluntarily allowed bob hall to compete after the state division of human rights ordered the marathon to show cause. the division ruled in 1979 that the new york city marathon and new york road runners club had to allow wheelchair athletes to compete, and confirmed this at appeal in 1980, but the new york supreme court ruled in 1981 that a ban on wheelchair racers was not discriminatory as the marathon was historically a foot race. however, by 1986 14 wheelchair athletes were competing, and an official wheelchair division was added to the marathon in 2000.some of the quickest people to complete a wheel-chair marathon include thomas geierpichler (austria) who won gold in men's t52-class marathon (no lower limb function) in 1 hr 49 min 7 sec in beijing china, on 17 september 2008; and, heinz frei (switzerland) who won the men's t54 marathon (for racers with spinal cord injuries) in a time of 1 hr 20 min and 14 sec in oita, japan, 31 october 1999. == statistics == === world records and world's best === world records were not officially recognized by the iaaf, now known as world athletics, until 1 january 2004; previously, the best times for the marathon were referred to as the 'world best'. courses must conform to world athletics standards for a record to be recognized. however, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible. typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters.the current world record time for men over the distance is 2 hours and 35 seconds, set in the chicago marathon by kelvin kiptum of kenya on 8 october 2023. the world record for women was set by tigst assefa of ethiopia in the berlin marathon on 24 september 2023, in 2 hours 11 minutes and 53 seconds. this broke the previous record set by brigid kosgei of kenya in the chicago marathon on 13 october 2019, in 2 hours 14 minutes and 4 seconds who broke the record paula radcliffe of great britain had set over 16 years earlier at the london marathon. === all-time top 25 === the following is a list of best times among the top 25 individuals who ever ran the marathon distance. subsequent times for each athlete are noted below the table. the data is correct as of 16 october 2023. ==== men ==== • all time performance top 25 as december 2023: •all time individual top 25 as december 2023 notes eliud kipchoge (kenya) ran a time of 1:59:40.2 at the ineos 1:59 challenge in vienna on 12 october 2019. this event was run with no other competitors, and with the assistance of fuel and hydration on demand, and in-out pacemakers. therefore, the attempt was not eligible for official ratification. this was faster than his previous assisted run of 2:00:25 at the nike breaking2 in monza on 6 may 2017, which was also ineligible. titus ekiru (kenya) ran a time of 2:02:57 at the milano city marathon on 16 may 2021, but was later was disqualified due to doping violations. geoffrey mutai (kenya) ran a time of 2:03:02 at the boston marathon on 18 april 2011 that was run on an assisted course (in the case of boston, a point-to-point, net downhill course in excess of the standards) and is therefore ineligible for record purposes per iaaf rule 260.28 moses mosop (kenya) ran a time of 2:03:06 at the boston marathon on 18 april 2011 that was run on an assisted course and is therefore ineligible for record purposes per iaaf rule 260.28below is a list of all other times equal or faster than 2:03:50: eliud kipchoge also ran 2:03:32 (2017). wilson kipsang kiprotich also ran 2:03:23 (2013), 2:03:42 (2011). alexander mutiso also ran 2:03:29 (2022). amos kipruto also ran 2:03:30 (2020). sisay lemma also ran 2:03:36 (2019). tamirat tola also ran 2:03:40 (2022). dennis kimetto also ran 2:03:45 (2013). bashir abdi also ran 2:03.47 (2023). ==== women ==== •correct as of january 2024. === season's bests === === oldest marathoner === fauja singh, then 100, finished the toronto waterfront marathon, becoming the first centenarian ever to officially complete that distance. singh, a british citizen, finished the race on 16 october 2011 with a time of 8:11:05.9, making him the oldest marathoner. because singh could not produce a birth certificate from rural 1911 colonial india, the place of his birth, his age could not be verified and his record was not accepted by the official governing body world masters athletics. johnny kelley ran his last full boston marathon at the documented age of 84 in 1992. he previously had won the boston marathon in both 1935 and 1945 respectively. between 1934 and 1950, johnny finished in the top five 15 times, consistently running in the 2:30s and finishing in second place a record seven times at boston. a fixture at boston for more than a half century, his 1992 61st start and 58th finish in boston is a record which still stands today. gladys burrill, a 92-year-old prospect, oregon woman and part-time resident of hawaii, previously held the guinness world records title of oldest person to complete a marathon with her 9 hours 53 minutes performance at the 2010 honolulu marathon. the records of the association of road racing statisticians, at that time, however, suggested that singh was overall the oldest marathoner, completing the 2004 london marathon at the age of 93 years and 17 days, and that burrill was the oldest female marathoner, completing the 2010 honolulu marathon at the age of 92 years and 19 days. singh's age was also reported to be 93 by other sources.in 2015, 92-year-old harriette thompson of charlotte, north carolina, completed the rock 'n' roll san diego marathon in 7 hours 24 minutes 36 seconds, thus becoming the oldest woman to complete a marathon. while gladys burrill was 92 years and 19 days old when she completed her record-setting marathon, harriette thompson was 92 years and 65 days old when she completed hers.english born canadian ed whitlock is the oldest to complete a marathon in under 3 hours at age 74, and under 4 hours at age 85. === youngest marathoner === budhia singh, a boy from odisha, india, completed his first marathon at age five. he trained under the coach biranchi das, who saw potential in him. in may 2006, budhia was temporarily banned from running by the ministers of child welfare, as his life could be at risk. his coach was also arrested for exploiting and cruelty to a child and was later murdered in an unrelated incident. budhia is now at a state-run sports academy.the youngest under 4 hours is mary etta boitano at age 7 years, 284 days; under 3 hours julie mullin at 10 years 180 days; and under 2:50 carrie garritson at 11 years 116 days. === participation === in 2016, running usa estimated that there were approximately 507,600 marathon finishers in the united states, while other sources reported greater than 550,000 finishers. the chart below from running usa provides the estimated u.s. marathon finisher totals going back to 1976. marathon running has become an obsession in china, with 22 marathon races in 2011 increasing to 400 in 2017. in 2015, 75 chinese runners participated in the boston marathon and this increased to 278 in 2017. === multiple marathons === as marathon running has become more popular, some athletes have undertaken challenges involving running a series of marathons. the 100 marathon club is intended to provide a focal point for all runners, particularly from the united kingdom or ireland, who have completed 100 or more races of marathon distance or longer. at least 10 of these events must be united kingdom or ireland road marathons. club chairman roger biggs has run more than 700 marathons or ultras. brian mills completed his 800th marathon on 17 september 2011. steve edwards, a member of the 100 marathon club, set the world record for running 500 marathons in the fastest average finish time of 3 hours 15 minutes, at the same time becoming the first man to run 500 marathons with an official time below 3 hours 30 minutes, on 11 november 2012 at milton keynes, england. the records took 24 years to achieve. edwards was 49 at the time.over 350 individuals have completed a marathon in each state of the united states plus washington, d.c., and some have done it as many as eight times. beverly paquin, a 22-year-old nurse from iowa, was the youngest woman to run a marathon in all 50 states in 2010. a few weeks later, still in 2010, morgan cummings (also 22) became the youngest woman to complete a marathon in all 50 states and dc. in 2004, chuck bryant of miami, florida, who lost his right leg below the knee, became the first amputee to finish this circuit. bryant has completed a total of 59 marathons on his prosthesis. twenty-seven people have run a marathon on each of the seven continents, and 31 people have run a marathon in each of the canadian provinces. in 1980, in what was termed the marathon of hope, terry fox, who had lost a leg to cancer and so ran with one artificial leg, attained 5,373 km (3,339 mi) of his proposed cross-canada cancer fundraising run, maintaining an average of over 37 km (23 mi), close to the planned marathon distance, for each of 143 consecutive days. on 25 september 2011, patrick finney of grapevine, texas became the first person with multiple sclerosis to finish a marathon in each state of the united states. in 2004, \"the disease had left him unable to walk. but unwilling to endure a life of infirmity, finney managed to regain his ability to balance on two feet, to walk – and eventually to run – through extensive rehabilitation therapy and new medications.\"in 2003, british adventurer sir ranulph fiennes completed seven marathons on seven continents in seven days. he completed this feat despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double heart bypass operation just four months before. this feat has since been eclipsed by irish ultramarathon runner richard donovan who in 2009 completed seven marathons on seven continents in under 132 hours (five and a half days). starting 1 february 2012 he improved on this by completing the 7 on 7 in under 120 hours or in less than five days.on 30 november 2013, 69-year-old larry macon set a guinness world record for most marathons run in a year by man by running 238 marathons. larry macon celebrated his 1,000th career marathon at the cowtown marathon in ft. worth on 24 february 2013.other goals are to attempt to run marathons on a series of consecutive weekends (richard worley on 159 weekends), or to run the most marathons during a particular year or the most in a lifetime. a pioneer in running multiple marathons was sy mah of toledo, ohio, who ran 524 before he died in 1988. as of 30 june 2007, horst preisler of germany had successfully completed 1214 marathons plus 347 ultramarathons, a total of 1561 events at marathon distance or longer. sigrid eichner, christian hottas and hans-joachim meyer have also all completed over 1000 marathons each. norm frank of the united states is credited with 945 marathons.christian hottas is meanwhile the first runner who ever completed 2000 marathons. he ran his 2000th at tui marathon hannover on 5 may 2013 together with a group of more than 80 friends from 11 countries, including 8 officers from the 100 marathons clubs u.k., north-america, germany, denmark, austria and italy. hottas completed his 2500th marathon on 4 december 2016.in 2010, stefaan engels, a belgian, set out to run the marathon distance every day of the year. because of a foot injury he had to resort to a handcycle near the end of january 2010. however, on 5 february he was fully recovered and decided to reset the counter back to zero. by 30 march he broke the existing record of akinori kusuda, from japan, who completed 52 marathons in a row in 2009. on 5 february 2011, engels had run 365 marathon distances in as many days.ricardo abad martínez, from spain, later ran 150 marathons in 150 consecutive days in 2009, and subsequently 500 marathons in a row, from october 2010 to february 2012.some runners compete to run the same marathons for the most consecutive years. for example, johnny kelley completed 58 boston marathons (he entered the race 61 times). currently, the longest consecutive streak of boston marathon finishes—45 in a row—is held by bennett beach, of bethesda, maryland. == olympic medalists == === men === === women === == world championships medalists == === men === === women === == general participation == most participants do not run a marathon to win. more important for most runners is their personal finishing time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish. strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance and a run–walk strategy. in 2005, the average marathon time in the u.s. was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women. in 2015, the men's and women's median marathon times were 4 hours 20 minutes 13 seconds and 4 hours 45 minutes 30 seconds respectively.a goal many runners aim for is to break certain time barriers. for example, recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours. other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons. the boston marathon, the oldest marathon in the united states, requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners. the new york city marathon also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry, at a significantly faster pace than boston's.typically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer (eight hours or more). many marathons around the world have such time limits by which all runners must have crossed the finish line. anyone slower than the limit will be picked up by a sweeper bus. in many cases the marathon organizers are required to reopen the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal. with the growth in popularity of marathon-running, many marathons across the united states and the world have been filling to capacity faster than ever before. when the boston marathon opened up registration for its 2011 running, the field capacity was filled within eight hours. === training === the long run is an important element in marathon training. recreational runners commonly try to reach a maximum of about 32 km (20 mi) in their longest weekly run and a total of about 64 km (40 mi) a week when training for the marathon, but wide variability exists in practice and in recommendations. more experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week. greater weekly training mileages can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance, but also carry a greater risk of training injury. most male elite marathon runners will complete weekly distances of over 160 km (100 mi). it is recommended that those new to running should get a checkup from their doctor, as there are certain warning signs and risk factors that should be evaluated before undertaking any new workout program, especially marathon training.many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally, for recovery, a period of tapering in the one to three weeks preceding the race. for beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of four months of running four days a week is recommended. many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10%. it is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program, to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses. the marathon training program itself would suppose variation between hard and easy training, with a periodization of the general plan.training programs can be found at the websites of runner's world, hal higdon, jeff galloway, runnersworld tulsa archived 30 may 2023 at the wayback machine, and the boston athletic association, and in numerous other published sources, including the websites of specific marathons. many local running stores sponsor training programs for the community. runnersworld tulsa archived 30 may 2023 at the wayback machine, for example, has half and full marathon training programs that consider an individual's pace and desired distance. these kinds of groups offer connection to your running community—an invaluable source of support, encouragement, and accountability. the last long training run might be undertaken up to two weeks prior to the event. many marathon runners also \"carbo-load\" (increase carbohydrate intake while holding total caloric intake constant) during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen. === glycogen and \"the wall\" === carbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage. glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy. runners can store about 8 mj or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30 km/18–20 miles of running. many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point. when glycogen runs low, the body must then obtain energy by burning stored fat, which does not burn as readily. when this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to \"hit the wall\". the aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches, is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the \"wall\" is not as dramatic. this is accomplished in part by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen.carbohydrate-based \"energy gels\" are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of \"hitting the wall\", as they provide easy to digest energy during the run. energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine. they need to be consumed with a certain amount of water. recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely. alternatives to gels include various forms of concentrated sugars, and foods high in simple carbohydrates that can be digested easily. many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them. consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick. runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race. it is also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers (nsaids, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), as these drugs may change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration. nsaids block the cox-2 enzyme pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandins. these prostaglandins may act as inflammation factors throughout the body, but they also play a crucial role in maintenance of water retention. in less than 5% of the whole population that take nsaids, individuals may be more negatively sensitive to renal prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. === temperature === a study of the performance of 1.8 million participants in the berlin, london, paris, boston, chicago, and new york marathons during the years from 2001 to 2010 found that runners recorded their fastest times when the temperature was around 6 °c (43 °f), with an increase of 10 °c (18 °f) leading to a 1.5% reduction in speed. a july 2020 study found that increasing temperatures affected faster runners' performance more than slower ones. === after a marathon === marathon participation may result in various medical, musculoskeletal, and dermatological complaints. delayed onset muscle soreness (doms) is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon. various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to doms. dermatological issues frequently include \"jogger's nipple\", \"jogger's toe\", and blisters.the immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time. changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction.after long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended. in addition, soaking the lower half of the body for approximately 20 minutes in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery. == health risks == marathon running has various health risks, though these can be diminished with preparation and care. training and the races themselves can put runners under stress. while very rare, even death is a possibility during a race. common minor health risks include blisters, tendonitis, fatigue, knee or ankle sprain, dehydration (electrolyte imbalance), and other conditions. many are categorised as overuse injuries. === cardiac health === in 2016, a systematic medical review found that the risk of sudden cardiac death during or immediately after a marathon was between 0.6 and 1.9 deaths per 100,000 participants, varying across the specific studies and the methods used, and not controlling for age or gender. since the risk is small, cardiac screening programs for marathons are uncommon. however, this review was not an attempt to assess the overall cardiac health impact of marathon running. a 2006 study of non-elite boston marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins that indicate heart damage or dysfunction (see troponin) and gave them echocardiogram scans, before and after the marathon. the study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had averaged fewer than 56 km (35 mi) of weekly training in the 4 months before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than 72 km (45 mi) of weekly training showed few or no heart problems.according to a canadian study presented in 2010, running a marathon can temporarily result in decreased function of more than half the muscle segments in the heart's main pumping chamber, but neighboring segments are generally able to compensate. full recovery is reached within three months. the fitter the runner, the less the effect. the runners with decreased left ventricle function had an average peak weekly training distance of 55.1 km (34.2 mi), while those who did not averaged 69.1 km (42.9 mi). the marathon was held in 35 °c (95 °f) weather. according to one of the researchers: \"regular exercise reduces cardiovascular risk by a factor of two or three in the long run, but while we're doing vigorous exercise such as marathon running, our cardiac risk increases by seven.\" === hydration === overconsumption is the most significant concern associated with water consumption during marathons. drinking excessive amounts of fluid during a race can lead to dilution of sodium in the blood, a condition called exercise-associated hyponatremia, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death. dr. lewis g. maharam, medical director for the new york city marathon, stated in 2005: \"there are no reported cases of dehydration causing death in the history of world running, but there are plenty of cases of people dying of hyponatremia.\"for example, dr. cynthia lucero died at the age of 28 while participating in the 2002 boston marathon. it was lucero's second marathon. at mile 22, lucero complained of feeling \"dehydrated and rubber-legged.\" she soon wobbled and collapsed to the ground, and was unconscious by the time the paramedics reached her. lucero was admitted to brigham and women's hospital and died two days later.lucero's cause of death was determined to be hyponatremic encephalopathy, a condition that causes swelling of the brain due to an imbalance of sodium in the blood known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (eah). while eah is sometimes referred to as \"water intoxication\", lucero drank large amounts of gatorade during the race, demonstrating that runners who consume sodium-containing sports drinks in excess of thirst can still develop eah. because hyponatremia is caused by excessive water retention, and not just loss of sodium, consumption of sports drinks or salty foods may not prevent hyponatremia.women are more prone to hyponatremia than men. a study in the new england journal of medicine found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 boston marathon had hyponatremia.the international marathon medical directors association (immda) advised in 2006 that fluid intake should be adjusted individually according to factors such as body weight, sex, climate, pace, fitness (vo2 max), and sweat rate, as fluid requirements can vary between people depending on these variables. the immda also recommended sports drinks that include carbohydrates and electrolytes instead of plain water and said that runners should \"drink to thirst\", trying to refrain from drinking at every fluid station before feeling thirsty. heat exposure leads to diminished thirst drive and thirst may not be a sufficient incentive to drink in many situations. the immda and hsl harpur hill give recommendations to drink fluid in small volumes frequently at an approximate rate falling between 100–250 ml (3.4–8.5 us fl oz) every 15 minutes. a patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in the blood. some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs. if anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water. === body temperature === exertional heat stroke is an emergency condition in which thermoregulation fails and the body temperature rises dangerously above 104 °f (40 °c). it becomes a greater risk in warm and humid weather, even for young and fit individuals. treatment requires rapid physical cooling of the body. == charity involvement == some charities seek to associate with various races. some marathon organizers set aside a portion of their limited entry slots for charity organizations to sell to members in exchange for donations. runners are given the option to sign up to run particular races, especially when marathon entries are no longer available to the general public. in some cases, charities organize their own marathon as a fund-raiser, gaining funds via entry fees or sponsorships. == culture == mars rover marathonin 2015 the mars rover opportunity attained the distance of a marathon from its starting location on mars, and the valley where it achieved this distance was called marathon valley, which was then explored. == see also == records marathon world record progression national records in the marathonlists list of marathon races list of marathoners list of marathon

      "artificial intelligence (ai) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or other living beings. it is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. such machines may be called ais. ai technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., google search), recommendation systems (used by youtube, amazon, and netflix), interacting via human speech (such as google assistant, siri, and alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., waymo), generative and creative tools (chatgpt and ai art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and go).alan turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence. artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. the field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of funding. funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous ai techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. this led to the ai spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the united states pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.the various sub-fields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. general intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.to solve these problems, ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. ai also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields. == goals == the general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research. === reasoning, problem-solving === early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. by the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger. even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early ai research could model. they solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. === knowledge representation === knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. an ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. knowledge bases need to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications. === planning and decision making === an \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. in automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. in automated decision making, the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. the decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. for each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.in classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. in most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.in some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. these can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be. a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. a policy associates a decision with each possible state. the policy could be calculated (e.g. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.game theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents. === learning === machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. it has been a part of ai from the beginning.there are several kinds of machine learning. unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization. === natural language processing === natural language processing (nlp) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as english. specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.early work, based on noam chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). margaret masterman believed that it was meaning, and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. in 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"gpt\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, sat test, gre test, and many other real-world applications. === perception === machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.the field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition, and robotic perception. === social intelligence === affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood. for example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. however, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject. === general intelligence === a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. == techniques == ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. === search and optimization === ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. there are two very different kinds of search used in ai: state space search and local search. ==== state space search ==== state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. for example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. the result is a search that is too slow or never completes. \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help to prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or go. it searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position. ==== local search ==== local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails). === logic === formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"every x is a y\" and \"there are some xs that are ys\").logical inference (or deduction) is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are already known to be true (the premises). a logical knowledge base also handles queries and assertions as a special case of inference. an inference rule describes what is a valid step in a proof. the most general inference rule is resolution. inference can be reduced to performing a search to find a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule. inference performed this way is intractable except for short proofs in restricted domains. no efficient, powerful and general method has been discovered. fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.non-monotonic logics are designed to handle default reasoning. other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains (see knowledge representation above). === probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning === many problems in ai (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for many problems, including reasoning (using the bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic bayesian networks).probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden markov models or kalman filters). precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. these tools include models such as markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design. === classifiers and statistical learning methods === the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. they can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. when a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.there are many kinds of classifiers in use. the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. k-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid-1990s, and kernel methods such as the support vector machine (svm) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at google, due in part to its scalability.neural networks are also used as classifiers. === artificial neural networks === an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. it is trained to recognise patterns, once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. there is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. in theory, a neural network can learn any function.in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons, deep learning uses multiple layers. convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other – this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object. === deep learning === deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. the multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. for example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification and others. the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023. the sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to gpus) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as imagenet. === gpt === generative pre-trained transformers (gpt) are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences (natural language processing). text-based gpt models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet. the pre-training consists in predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). throughout this pre-training, gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world, and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (rlhf). current gpt models are still prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data. they are used in chatbots which allow you to ask a question or request a task in simple text.current models and services include: bard, chatgpt, grok, claude, copilot and llama. multimodal gpt models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound and text. === specialized hardware and software === in the late 2010s, graphics processing units (gpus) that were increasingly designed with ai-specific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (cpus) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. historically, specialized languages, such as lisp, prolog, python and others, had been used. == applications == ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as google search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by netflix, youtube or amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (adsense, facebook), virtual assistants (such as siri or alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, adas and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (microsoft translator, google translate), facial recognition (apple's face id or microsoft's deepface and google's facenet) and image labeling (used by facebook, apple's iphoto and tiktok). === health and medicine === the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. through the lens of the hippocratic oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. for medical research, ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. new ai tools can deepen our understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. for example, alphafold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3d structure of a protein. in 2023 it was reported that ai guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. === games === game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test ai's most advanced techniques. deep blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, garry kasparov, on 11 may 1997. in 2011, in a jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, ibm's question answering system, watson, defeated the two greatest jeopardy! champions, brad rutter and ken jennings, by a significant margin. in march 2016, alphago won 4 out of 5 games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol, becoming the first computer go-playing system to beat a professional go player without handicaps. then in 2017 it defeated ke jie, who was the best go player in the world. other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program pluribus. deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinfrocement learning models, such as with muzero, which could be trained to play chess, go, or atari games. in 2019, deepmind's alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. in 2021 an ai agent competed in a playstation gran turismo competition, winning against four of the world’s best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. === military === various countries are deploying ai military applications. the main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. ai was incorporated into military operations in iraq and syria. in november 2023, us vice president kamala harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of ia. the commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military ai with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology. === generative ai === in the early 2020s, generative ai gained widespread prominence. in march 2023, 58% of us adults had heard about chatgpt and 14% had tried it. the increasing realism and ease-of-use of ai-based text-to-image generators such as midjourney, dall-e, and stable diffusion sparked a trend of viral ai-generated photos. widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of pope francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of donald trump, and a hoax of an attack on the pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts. === industry specific tasks === there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. in a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated \"ai\" in some offerings or processes. a few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. in agriculture, ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. agronomists use ai to conduct research and development. ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights\" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. it could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. == ethics == ai, like any powerful technology, has potential benefits and potential risks. ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: demis hassabis of deep mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". however, as the use of ai has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.anyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs to factor ethics into their ai training processes and strive to avoid bias. this is especially true when using ai algorithms that are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. === risks and harm === ==== privacy and copyright ==== machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. technology companies collect a wide range of data from their users, including online activity, geolocation data, video and audio. for example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, amazon have recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temps to listen to and transcribe some of them. opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. since 2016, some privacy experts, such as cynthia dwork, began to view privacy in terms of fairness. brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\".generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under a rationale of \"fair use\". also website owners who do not wish to have their copyrighted content be ai indexed or ‘scraped’ can add code to their site, as you would, if you did not want your website to be indexed by a search engine which is currently available to certain services such as openai. experts disagree about how well, and under what circumstances, this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". in 2023, leading authors (including john grisham and jonathan franzen) sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai. ==== misinformation ==== youtube, facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the ai recommended more of it. users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. this convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. after the u.s. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem. in 2022, generative ai began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films or human writing. it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks. ==== algorithmic bias and fairness ==== machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data. the developers may not be aware that the bias exists. bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.fairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias. it has become serious area of academic study within ai. researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define \"fairness\" in a way that satisfies all stakeholders.on june 28, 2015, google photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called \"sample size disparity\". google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". eight years later, in 2023, google photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from apple, facebook, microsoft and amazon.compas is a commercial program widely used by u.s. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. in 2016, julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. in 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). the feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". moritz hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"criticism of compas highlighted a deeper problem with the misuse of ai. machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. unfortunately, if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. it is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among ai engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.at its 2022 conference on fairness, accountability, and transparency (acm facct 2022) the association for computing machinery, in seoul, south korea, presented and published findings recommending that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed. ==== lack of transparency ==== many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. but some popular explainability techniques exist.there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. for example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.people who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. doctors, for example, are required to clearly and completely explain the reasoning behind any decision they make. early drafts of the european union's general data protection regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.darpa established the xai (\"explainable artificial intelligence\") program in 2014 to try and solve these problems.there are several potential solutions to the transparency problem. shap helps visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. lime can locally approximate a model with a simpler, interpretable model. multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. deconvolution, deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. ==== conflict, surveillance and weaponized ai ==== a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. by 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. these weapons are considered especially dangerous for several reasons: if they kill an innocent person it is not clear who should be held accountable, it is unlikely they will reliably choose targets, and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. in 2014, 30 nations (including china) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations' convention on certain conventional weapons, however the united states and others disagreed.ai provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation; advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.ai facial recognition systems are used for mass surveillance, notably in china. in 2019, bengaluru, india deployed ai-managed traffic signals. this system uses cameras to monitor traffic density and adjust signal timing based on the interval needed to clear traffic. terrorists, criminals and rogue states can use weaponized ai such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons. machine-learning ai is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. ==== technological unemployment ==== from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments, for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.in the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with ai. a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated 47% of u.s. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an oecd report classified only 9% of u.s. jobs as \"high risk\". the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; the economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that ai could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the industrial revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.in april 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for chinese video game illlustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. ==== existential risk ==== it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. this could, as physicist stephen hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\". this scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. these sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. first, ai does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" in order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".second, yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. the essential parts of civilization are not physical. things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai. personalities such as stephen hawking, bill gates, and elon musk have expressed concern about existential risk from ai.in the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. however, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.ai pioneers including fei-fei li, geoffrey hinton, yoshua bengio, cynthia breazeal, rana el kaliouby, demis hassabis, joy buolamwini, and sam altman have expressed concerns about the risks of ai. in 2023, many leading ai experts issued the joint statement that \"mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. ai pioneer juergen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, ai research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" andrew ng also argued that \"it’s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on ai—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" yann lecun \"scoffs at his peers’ dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" ==== limiting ai ==== possible options for limiting ai include: using embedded ethics or constitutional ai where companies or governments can add a policy, restricting high levels of compute power in training, restricting the ability to rewrite its own code base, restrict certain ai techniques but not in the training phase, open-source (transparency) vs proprietary (could be more restricted), backup model with redundancy, restricting security, privacy and copyright, restricting or controlling the memory, real-time monitoring, risk analysis, emergency shut-off, rigorous simulation and testing, model certification, assess known vulnerabilities, restrict the training material, restrict access to the internet, issue terms of use. === ethical machines and alignment === friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. eliezer yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk.machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, and was founded at an aaai symposium in 2005.other approaches include wendell wallach's \"artificial moral agents\" and stuart j. russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. === frameworks === artificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an ai system. an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum values – developed by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas: respect the dignity of individual people connect with other people sincerely, openly and inclusively care for the wellbeing of everyone protect social values, justice and the public interestother developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference, the montreal declaration for responsible ai, and the ieee's ethics of autonomous systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. === regulation === the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (ai); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. according to ai index at stanford, the annual number of ai-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai. most eu member states had released national ai strategies, as had canada, china, india, japan, mauritius, the russian federation, saudi arabia, united arab emirates, us and vietnam. others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy, including bangladesh, malaysia and tunisia. the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june 2020, stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. henry kissinger, eric schmidt, and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate ai. in 2023, openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. in 2023, the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.in a 2022 ipsos survey, attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country; 78% of chinese citizens, but only 35% of americans, agreed that \"products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks\". a 2023 reuters/ipsos poll found that 61% of americans agree, and 22% disagree, that ai poses risks to humanity. in a 2023 fox news poll, 35% of americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate ai, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".in november 2023, the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 28 countries including the united states, china, and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. == history == the study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. the study of logic led directly to alan turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the church–turing thesis. this, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".alan turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of ai – though it is now lost. the first available paper generally recognized as \"ai\" was mccullouch and pitts design for turing-complete \"artificial neurons\" in 1943 – the first mathematical model of a neural network. the paper was influenced by turing's earlier paper 'on computable numbers' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.the term 'machine intelligence' was used by alan turing during his life which was later often referred to as 'artificial intelligence' after his death in 1954. in 1950 turing published the best known of his papers 'computing machinery and intelligence', the paper introduced his concept of what is now known as the turing test to the general public. then followed three radio broadcasts on ai by turing, the lectures: 'intelligent machinery, a heretical theory’, ‘can digital computers think’? and the panel discussion ‘can automatic calculating machines be said to think’. by 1956 computer intelligence had been actively pursued for more than a decade in britain; the earliest ai programmes were written there in 1951–1952.in 1951, using a ferranti mark 1 computer of the university of manchester, checkers and chess programs were wrote where you could play against the computer. the field of american ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in 1956. the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the 1960s. they and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking english. artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and us universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.they had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. both the u.s. and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the u.s. congress to fund more productive projects. minsky's and papert's book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. the \"ai winter\", a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult, followed.in the early 1980s, ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. by 1985, the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars. at the same time, japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the u.s. and british governments to restore funding for academic research. however, beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987, ai once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. a number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. robotics researchers, such as rodney brooks, rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. judea pearl, lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. but the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by geoffrey hinton and others. in 1990, yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.ai gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. this \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). by 2000, solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"agi\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. for many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as imagenet). deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai. the amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019, and wipo reported that ai was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents. according to 'ai impacts', about $50 billion annually was invested in \"ai\" around 2022 in the us alone and about 20% of new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in \"ai\"; about 800,000 \"ai\"-related us job openings existed in 2022. the large majority of the advances have occurred within the united states, with its companies, universities, and research labs leading artificial intelligence research.in 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. == philosophy == === defining artificial intelligence === alan turing wrote in 1950 \"i propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" he advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". he devised the turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"russell and norvig agree with turing that ai must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\". however, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. \"aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\" ai founder john mccarthy agreed, writing that \"artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".mccarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\" another ai founder, marvin minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". these definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. another definition has been adopted by google, a major practitioner in the field of ai. this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. === evaluating approaches to ai === no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history. the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). this approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow (see below). critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers. ==== symbolic ai and its limits ==== symbolic ai (or \"gofai\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. they were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or iq tests. in the 1960s, newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"however, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for ai, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, ai research came to agree with him.the issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision. the emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. ==== neat vs. scruffy ==== \"neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. this issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, but eventually was seen as irrelevant. modern ai has elements of both. ==== soft vs. hard computing ==== finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful ai programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. ==== narrow vs. general ai ==== ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow ai) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. the experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. === machine consciousness, sentience and mind === the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. russell and norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" however, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction. ==== consciousness ==== david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. for example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like. ==== computationalism and functionalism ==== computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam.philosopher john searle characterized this position as \"strong ai\": \"the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind. ==== robot rights ==== if a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also suffer; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights. any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. this issue has been considered in fiction for centuries, and is now being considered by, for example, california's institute for the future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature. == future == === superintelligence and the singularity === a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. the improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what i. j. good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and vernor vinge called a \"singularity\".however, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an s-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. === transhumanism === robot designer hans moravec, cyberneticist kevin warwick, and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. this idea, called transhumanism, has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger.edward fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by samuel butler's \"darwin among the machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998. == in fiction == thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.a common trope in these works began with mary shelley's frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. this includes such works as arthur c. clarke's and stanley kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey (both 1968), with hal 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship, as well as the terminator (1984) and the matrix (1999). in contrast, the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still (1951) and bishop from aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. this appears in karel čapek's r.u.r., the films a.i. artificial intelligence and ex machina, as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep?, by philip k. dick. dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence. == see also == ai effect artificial intelligence detection

computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.algorithms and data structures are central to computer science. the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. the fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities. computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data. the fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated. the turing award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science. == history == the earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.wilhelm schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623. in 1673, gottfried leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the stepped reckoner. leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. in 1820, thomas de colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. charles babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his difference engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his analytical engine. he started developing this machine in 1834, and \"in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer\". \"a crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the jacquard loom\" making it infinitely programmable. in 1843, during the translation of a french article on the analytical engine, ada lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer. around 1885, herman hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of ibm. following babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, percy ludgate in 1909 published the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. in 1914, the spanish engineer leonardo torres quevedo published his essays on automatics, and designed, inspired by babbage, a theoretical electromechanical calculating machine which was to be controlled by a read-only program. the paper also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic. in 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, torres presented in paris the electromechanical arithmometer, a prototype that demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine, on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically. in 1937, one hundred years after babbage's impossible dream, howard aiken convinced ibm, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ascc/harvard mark i, based on babbage's analytical engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. when the machine was finished, some hailed it as \"babbage's dream come true\". during the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the atanasoff–berry computer and eniac, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors. as it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general. in 1945, ibm founded the watson scientific computing laboratory at columbia university in new york city. the renovated fraternity house on manhattan's west side was ibm's first laboratory devoted to pure science. the lab is the forerunner of ibm's research division, which today operates research facilities around the world. ultimately, the close relationship between ibm and columbia university was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946. computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s. the world's first computer science degree program, the cambridge diploma in computer science, began at the university of cambridge computer laboratory in 1953. the first computer science department in the united states was formed at purdue university in 1962. since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights. == etymology and scope == although first proposed in 1956, the term \"computer science\" appears in a 1959 article in communications of the acm, in which louis fein argues for the creation of a graduate school in computer sciences analogous to the creation of harvard business school in 1921. louis justifies the name by arguing that, like management science, the subject is applied and interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteristics typical of an academic discipline. his efforts, and those of others such as numerical analyst george forsythe, were rewarded: universities went on to create such departments, starting with purdue in 1962. despite its name, a significant amount of computer science does not involve the study of computers themselves. because of this, several alternative names have been proposed. certain departments of major universities prefer the term computing science, to emphasize precisely that difference. danish scientist peter naur suggested the term datalogy, to reflect the fact that the scientific discipline revolves around data and data treatment, while not necessarily involving computers. the first scientific institution to use the term was the department of datalogy at the university of copenhagen, founded in 1969, with peter naur being the first professor in datalogy. the term is used mainly in the scandinavian countries. an alternative term, also proposed by naur, is data science; this is now used for a multi-disciplinary field of data analysis, including statistics and databases. in the early days of computing, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of computing were suggested in the communications of the acm—turingineer, turologist, flow-charts-man, applied meta-mathematician, and applied epistemologist. three months later in the same journal, comptologist was suggested, followed next year by hypologist. the term computics has also been suggested. in europe, terms derived from contracted translations of the expression \"automatic information\" (e.g. \"informazione automatica\" in italian) or \"information and mathematics\" are often used, e.g. informatique (french), informatik (german), informatica (italian, dutch), informática (spanish, portuguese), informatika (slavic languages and hungarian) or pliroforiki (πληροφορική, which means informatics) in greek. similar words have also been adopted in the uk (as in the school of informatics, university of edinburgh). \"in the u.s., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain.\"a folkloric quotation, often attributed to—but almost certainly not first formulated by—edsger dijkstra, states that \"computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.\" the design and deployment of computers and computer systems is generally considered the province of disciplines other than computer science. for example, the study of computer hardware is usually considered part of computer engineering, while the study of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often called information technology or information systems. however, there has been exchange of ideas between the various computer-related disciplines. computer science research also often intersects other disciplines, such as cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physics, biology, earth science, statistics, philosophy, and logic. computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with some observers saying that computing is a mathematical science. early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as kurt gödel, alan turing, john von neumann, rózsa péter and alonzo church and there continues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two fields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory, domain theory, and algebra.the relationship between computer science and software engineering is a contentious issue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term \"software engineering\" means, and how computer science is defined. david parnas, taking a cue from the relationship between other engineering and science disciplines, has claimed that the principal focus of computer science is studying the properties of computation in general, while the principal focus of software engineering is the design of specific computations to achieve practical goals, making the two separate but complementary disciplines.the academic, political, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis or with an engineering emphasis. computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with computational science. both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research. == philosophy == === epistemology of computer science === despite the word \"science\" in its name, there is debate over whether or not computer science is a discipline of science, mathematics, or engineering. allen newell and herbert a. simon argued in 1975, computer science is an empirical discipline. we would have called it an experimental science, but like astronomy, economics, and geology, some of its unique forms of observation and experience do not fit a narrow stereotype of the experimental method. nonetheless, they are experiments. each new machine that is built is an experiment. actually constructing the machine poses a question to nature; and we listen for the answer by observing the machine in operation and analyzing it by all analytical and measurement means available. it has since been argued that computer science can be classified as an empirical science since it makes use of empirical testing to evaluate the correctness of programs, but a problem remains in defining the laws and theorems of computer science (if any exist) and defining the nature of experiments in computer science. proponents of classifying computer science as an engineering discipline argue that the reliability of computational systems is investigated in the same way as bridges in civil engineering and airplanes in aerospace engineering. they also argue that while empirical sciences observe what presently exists, computer science observes what is possible to exist and while scientists discover laws from observation, no proper laws have been found in computer science and it is instead concerned with creating phenomena.proponents of classifying computer science as a mathematical discipline argue that computer programs are physical realizations of mathematical entities and programs can be deductively reasoned through mathematical formal methods. computer scientists edsger w. dijkstra and tony hoare regard instructions for computer programs as mathematical sentences and interpret formal semantics for programming languages as mathematical axiomatic systems. === paradigms of computer science === a number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science. peter wegner argued that those paradigms are science, technology, and mathematics. peter denning's working group argued that they are theory, abstraction (modeling), and design. amnon h. eden described them as the \"rationalist paradigm\" (which treats computer science as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretical computer science, and mainly employs deductive reasoning), the \"technocratic paradigm\" (which might be found in engineering approaches, most prominently in software engineering), and the \"scientific paradigm\" (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural sciences, identifiable in some branches of artificial intelligence). computer science focuses on methods involved in design, specification, programming, verification, implementation and testing of human-made computing systems. == fields == as a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.csab, formerly called computing sciences accreditation board—which is made up of representatives of the association for computing machinery (acm), and the ieee computer society (ieee cs)—identifies four areas that it considers crucial to the discipline of computer science: theory of computation, algorithms and data structures, programming methodology and languages, and computer elements and architecture. in addition to these four areas, csab also identifies fields such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networking and communication, database systems, parallel computation, distributed computation, human–computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computation as being important areas of computer science. === theoretical computer science === theoretical computer science is mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its motivation from the practical and everyday computation. its aim is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodologies. ==== theory of computation ==== according to peter denning, the fundamental question underlying computer science is, \"what can be automated?\" theory of computation is focused on answering fundamental questions about what can be computed and what amount of resources are required to perform those computations. in an effort to answer the first question, computability theory examines which computational problems are solvable on various theoretical models of computation. the second question is addressed by computational complexity theory, which studies the time and space costs associated with different approaches to solving a multitude of computational problems. the famous p = np? problem, one of the millennium prize problems, is an open problem in the theory of computation. ==== information and coding theory ==== information theory, closely related to probability and statistics, is related to the quantification of information. this was developed by claude shannon to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data. coding theory is the study of the properties of codes (systems for converting information from one form to another) and their fitness for a specific application. codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, and more recently also for network coding. codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. ==== data structures and algorithms ==== data structures and algorithms are the studies of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency. ==== programming language theory and formal methods ==== programming language theory is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individual features. it falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and linguistics. it is an active research area, with numerous dedicated academic journals. formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based technique for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems. the use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design. they form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. for industrial use, tool support is required. however, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of utmost importance. formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also type systems and algebraic data types to problems in software and hardware specification and verification. === applied computer science === ==== computer graphics and visualization ==== computer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. the study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including computer vision, image processing, and computational geometry, and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and video games. ==== image and sound processing ==== information can take the form of images, sound, video or other multimedia. bits of information can be streamed via signals. its processing is the central notion of informatics, the european view on computing, which studies information processing algorithms independently of the type of information carrier – whether it is electrical, mechanical or biological. this field plays important role in information theory, telecommunications, information engineering and has applications in medical image computing and speech synthesis, among others. what is the lower bound on the complexity of fast fourier transform algorithms? is one of unsolved problems in theoretical computer science. ==== computational science, finance and engineering ==== scientific computing (or computational science) is the field of study concerned with constructing mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems. a major usage of scientific computing is simulation of various processes, including computational fluid dynamics, physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are spice, as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs. the latter includes essential design software for integrated circuits. ==== social computing and human–computer interaction ==== social computing is an area that is concerned with the intersection of social behavior and computational systems. human–computer interaction research develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers. ==== software engineering ==== software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying the software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. it is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software—it does not just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal arrangement and maintenance. for example software testing, systems engineering, technical debt and software development processes. ==== artificial intelligence ==== artificial intelligence (ai) aims to or is required to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communication found in humans and animals. from its origins in cybernetics and in the dartmouth conference (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence. ai is associated in the popular mind with robotic development, but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of software development, which require computational understanding. the starting point in the late 1940s was alan turing's question \"can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the turing test is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. but the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data. === computer systems === ==== computer architecture and organization ==== computer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. it focuses largely on the way by which the central processing unit performs internally and accesses addresses in memory. computer engineers study computational logic and design of computer hardware, from individual processor components, microcontrollers, personal computers to supercomputers and embedded systems. the term \"architecture\" in computer literature can be traced to the work of lyle r. johnson and frederick p. brooks jr., members of the machine organization department in ibm's main research center in 1959. ==== concurrent, parallel and distributed computing ==== concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. a number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including petri nets, process calculi and the parallel random access machine model. when multiple computers are connected in a network while using concurrency, this is known as a distributed system. computers within that distributed system have their own private memory, and information can be exchanged to achieve common goals. ==== computer networks ==== this branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide. ==== computer security and cryptography ==== computer security is a branch of computer technology with the objective of protecting information from unauthorized access, disruption, or modification while maintaining the accessibility and usability of the system for its intended users. historical cryptography is the art of writing and deciphering secret messages. modern cryptography is the scientific study of problems relating to distributed computations that can be attacked. technologies studied in modern cryptography include symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, key-agreement protocols, blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and garbled circuits. ==== databases and data mining ==== a database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through database models and query languages. data mining is a process of discovering patterns in large data sets. == discoveries == the philosopher of computing bill rapaport noted three great insights of computer science: gottfried wilhelm leibniz's, george boole's, alan turing's, claude shannon's, and samuel morse's insight: there are only two objects that a computer has to deal with in order to represent \"anything\".all the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as \"on/off\", \"magnetized/de-magnetized\", \"high-voltage/low-voltage\", etc.). alan turing's insight: there are only five actions that a computer has to perform in order to do \"anything\".every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:move left one location; move right one location; read symbol at current location; print 0 at current location; print 1 at current location. corrado böhm and giuseppe jacopini's insight: there are only three ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do \"anything\".only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones: sequence: first do this, then do that; selection: if such-and-such is the case, then do this, else do that; repetition: while such-and-such is the case, do this. the three rules of boehm's and jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of goto (which means it is more elementary than structured programming). == programming paradigms == programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. common programming paradigms include: functional programming, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. it is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. imperative programming, a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. in much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates. object-oriented programming, a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. a feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. thus object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another. service-oriented programming, a programming paradigm that uses \"services\" as the unit of computer work, to design and implement integrated business applications and mission critical software programsmany languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities. == research == conferences are important events for computer science research. during these conferences, researchers from the public and private sectors present their recent work and meet. unlike in most other academic fields, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is greater than that of journal publications. one proposed explanation for this is the quick development of this relatively new field requires rapid review and distribution of results, a task better handled by conferences than by journals. == education == computer science, known by its near synonyms, computing, computer studies, has been taught in uk schools since the days of batch processing, mark sensitive cards and paper tape but usually to a select few students. in 1981, the bbc produced a micro-computer and classroom network and computer studies became common for gce o level students (11–16-year-old), and computer science to a level students. its importance was recognised, and it became a compulsory part of the national curriculum, for key stage 3 & 4. in september 2014 it became an entitlement for all pupils over the age of 4.in the us, with 14,000 school districts deciding the curriculum, provision was fractured. according to a 2010 report by the association for computing machinery (acm) and computer science teachers association (csta), only 14 out of 50 states have adopted significant education standards for high school computer science. according to a 2021 report, only 51% of high schools in the us offer computer science.israel, new zealand, and south korea have included computer science in their national secondary education curricula, and several others are following. == see also == == notes == == references

      "data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine). data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.data science is a \"concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods\" to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data. it uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. however, data science is different from computer science and information science. turing award winner jim gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.a data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to create insights from data. == foundations == data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from typically large data sets and applying the knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in a wide range of application domains. the field encompasses preparing data for analysis, formulating data science problems, analyzing data, developing data-driven solutions, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in a broad range of application domains. as such, it incorporates skills from computer science, statistics, information science, mathematics, data visualization, information visualization, data sonification, data integration, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business. statistician nathan yau, drawing on ben fry, also links data science to human–computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data. in 2015, the american statistical association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities. === relationship to statistics === many statisticians, including nate silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics. others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data. vasant dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. in contrast, data science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., from images, text, sensors, transactions, customer information, etc.) and emphasizes prediction and action. andrew gelman of columbia university has described statistics as a non-essential part of data science.stanford professor david donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by the size of datasets or use of computing and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data-science program. he describes data science as an applied field growing out of traditional statistics. == etymology == === early usage === in 1962, john tukey described a field he called \"data analysis\", which resembles modern data science. in 1985, in a lecture given to the chinese academy of sciences in beijing, c. f. jeff wu used the term \"data science\" for the first time as an alternative name for statistics. later, attendees at a 1992 statistics symposium at the university of montpellier ii acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focused on data of various origins and forms, combining established concepts and principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.the term \"data science\" has been traced back to 1974, when peter naur proposed it as an alternative name to computer science. in 1996, the international federation of classification societies became the first conference to specifically feature data science as a topic. however, the definition was still in flux. after the 1985 lecture at the chinese academy of sciences in beijing, in 1997 c. f. jeff wu again suggested that statistics should be renamed data science. he reasoned that a new name would help statistics shed inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting or limited to describing data. in 1998, hayashi chikio argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis.during the 1990s, popular terms for the process of finding patterns in datasets (which were increasingly large) included \"knowledge discovery\" and \"data mining\". === modern usage === in 2012, technologists thomas h. davenport and dj patil declared \"data scientist: the sexiest job of the 21st century\", a catchphrase that was picked up even by major-city newspapers like the new york times and the boston globe. a decade later, they reaffirmed it, stating that \"the job is more in demand than ever with employers\".the modern conception of data science as an independent discipline is sometimes attributed to william s. cleveland. in a 2001 paper, he advocated an expansion of statistics beyond theory into technical areas; because this would significantly change the field, it warranted a new name. \"data science\" became more widely used in the next few years: in 2002, the committee on data for science and technology launched the data science journal. in 2003, columbia university launched the journal of data science. in 2014, the american statistical association's section on statistical learning and data mining changed its name to the section on statistical learning and data science, reflecting the ascendant popularity of data science.the professional title of \"data scientist\" has been attributed to dj patil and jeff hammerbacher in 2008. though it was used by the national science board in their 2005 report \"long-lived digital data collections: enabling research and education in the 21st century\", it referred broadly to any key role in managing a digital data collection.there is still no consensus on the definition of data science, and it is considered by some to be a buzzword. big data is a related marketing term. data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations. == data science and data analysis == data science and data analysis are both important disciplines in the field of data management and analysis, but they differ in several key ways. while both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an interdisciplinary field that involves the application of statistical, computational, and machine learning methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.data analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. this can involve tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between variables. data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. for example, a data analyst might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.data science, on the other hand, is a more complex and iterative process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. in addition to statistical analysis, data science often involves tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. for instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences.while data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. they work at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.despite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, programming, and data visualization, as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. moreover, both fields benefit from critical thinking and domain knowledge, as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.in summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of data management and analysis. data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from structured data, while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines statistical analysis, computational methods, and machine learning to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven decision-making. both fields play vital roles in leveraging the power of data to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems across various domains. == history == == see

      "fintech, a clipped compound of \"financial technology\", refers to firms using new technology to compete with traditional financial methods in the delivery of financial services. artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data are regarded as the \"abcd\" (four key areas) of fintech. the use of smartphones for mobile banking, investing, borrowing services, and cryptocurrency are examples of technologies designed to make financial services more accessible to the general public. fintech companies consist of both startups and established financial institutions and technology companies trying to replace or enhance the usage of financial services provided by existing financial companies. == key areas == === academics === artificial intelligence (ai), blockchain, cloud computing, and big data are considered the four key areas of fintech. artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast with “natural intelligence” displayed by humans and animals. ai is assuming an increasingly important role in traditional banking and finance as it provides technologies such as voice recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision for user-account management, machine learning methods, and deep learning networks for anti-money laundering, fraud detection and credit modeling. mobile and internet payment systems are closely connected to cloud computing. the past ten years have witnessed increasing adoption of cloud computing by financial institutions around the globe. === industry === financial technology has been used to automate investments, insurance, trading, banking services and risk management.robo-advisers are a class of automated financial adviser that provide financial advice or investment management online with moderate to very little human intervention. they provide digital financial advice based on mathematical rules or algorithms and can even create and manage automated investment portfolios. this can provide a lower-cost alternative to a human adviser and also has the ability to avoid human error and bias.global investment in financial technology increased more than 12,000% from $930 million in 2008 to $121.6 billion in 2020. 2019 saw a record high with the total global investment in financial technology being $215.3 billion, of which q3 alone accounted for $144.7 billion in investment.in h1 2021, fintech deal volume hit 2,456 deals accounting for $98 billion in investment. global vc investment was higher than $52 billion in h1’21, close to the annual record of $54 billion seen in 2018.h1’21 saw $21 billion in corporate-affiliated vc investment. cvc deal volume reached a high of 284 in q1’21, and then grew further to 312 in q2’21.the americas saw about $51.4 billion of fintech investment in h1’21, with the us alone accounting for $42.1 billion. in the emea region, investment in fintech was very robust at $39.1 billion. in asia-pacific, fintech investment grew between h2’20 and h1’21—rising from $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion, although it was subdued in comparison with previous record highs.the nascent financial technology industry in london has seen rapid growth over the last few years, according to the office of the mayor of london. forty percent of the city of london's workforce is employed in financial and technology services. as of april 2019, about 76,500 people form the uk-wide fintech workforce, and this number is projected to rise to 105,500 by 2030. of the current fintech workforce in the uk, 42% of workers are from overseas.in europe, $1.5 billion was invested in financial technology companies in 2014, with london-based companies receiving $539 million, amsterdam-based companies $306 million, and stockholm-based companies receiving $266 million in investment. after london, stockholm is the second highest funded city in europe in the past 10 years. europe's fintech deals reached a five-quarter high, rising from 37 in q4 2015 to 47 in q1 2016. lithuania is starting to become a northern european hub for financial technology companies since the news in 2016 about the exit of britain from the european union. lithuania has issued 51 fintech licenses since 2016, 32 of those in 2017.fintech companies in the united states raised $12.4 billion in 2018, a 43% increase over 2017 figures. in the asia pacific region, the growth will see a new financial technology hub to be opened in sydney, in april 2015. according to kpmg, sydney's financial services sector in 2017 creates 9 per cent of national gdp and is bigger than the financial services sector in either hong kong or singapore. a financial technology innovation lab was launched in hong kong in 2015. in 2015, the monetary authority of singapore launched an initiative named fintech and information group to draw in start-ups from around the world. it pledged to spend $225 million in the fintech sector over the next five years.while singapore has been one of the central fintech hubs in asia, start ups in the sector from vietnam and indonesia have been attracting more venture capital investments in recent years. since 2014, southeast asian fintech companies have increased vc funding from $35 million to $679 million in 2018 and $1.14 billion in 2019.africa's overall fintech sector has expanded quickly. there were more than 1000 active businesses as of april 2022, up from 450 in 2020. the venture capital sector, which saw deal value rise from $485 million in 2020 to $3.23 billion in 2021, was mostly responsible for the increase in investment in africa. about half of this investment was made in fintech with nigeria, kenya and south africa remaining key markets in the west, east, and south respectively. == technologies == fintech companies use a variety of technologies, including artificial intelligence (ai), big data, robotic process automation (rpa), and blockchain. ai algorithms can provide insight into customer spending habits, allowing financial institutions to better understand their clients. chatbots are another ai-driven tool that banks are starting to use to help with customer service. ai enables personalized financial services, enhanced fraud prevention, financial inclusion, and sustainable investing. it's anticipated to drive massive value creation in the fintech sector, notably in predictive finance and automated decision-making. advancements in deep learning and large language models (llm) are pivotal for ai-driven investment strategies, enabling real-time market adjustments and personalized investment strategies tailored to individual risk profiles. furthermore, ai and machine learning (ml) contribute to improved efficiency, better risk management, cost savings, and an enhanced customer experience in financial institutions.big data can predict client investments and market changes in order to create new strategies and portfolios, analyze customer spending habits, improve fraud detection, and create marketing strategies.robotic process automation is an artificial intelligence technology that focuses on automating specific repetitive tasks. rpa helps to process financial information such as accounts payable and receivable more efficiently than the manual process and often more accurately.blockchain is an emerging technology in finance which has driven significant investment from many companies. the decentralized nature of blockchain can eliminate the need for a third party to execute transactions. == awards and recognition == financial magazine forbes created a list of the leading disruptors in financial technology for its forbes 2021 global fintech 50. in europe there is a list called the fintech 50, which aims to recognise the most innovative companies in fintech.a report published in february 2016 by ey commissioned by the uk treasury compared seven leading fintech hubs: the united kingdom, california, new york city, singapore, germany, australia and hong kong. it ranked california first for 'talent' and 'capital', the united kingdom first for 'government policy', and new york city first for 'demand'.for the past few years, pwc has posted a report called the \"global fintech report\". the 2019 report covers many topics of the financial technology sector, describing the landscape of the fintech industry, and some of the emerging technologies in the sector. and it provides strategies for financial institutions on how to incorporate more \"fintech\" technologies into their business. == outlook == finance is seen as one of the industries most vulnerable to disruption by software because financial services, much like publishing, are made of information rather than concrete goods. in particular blockchains have the potential to reduce the cost of transacting in a financial system. while finance has been shielded by regulation until now, and weathered the dot-com boom without major upheaval, a new wave of startups is increasingly \"disaggregating\" global banks. however, aggressive enforcement of the bank secrecy act and money transmission regulations represents an ongoing threat to fintech companies. in response, the international monetary fund (imf) and the world bank jointly presented bali fintech agenda on october 11, 2018 which consists of 12 policy elements acting as a guidelines for various governments and central banking institutions to adopt and deploy \"rapid advances in financial technology\".the new york venture capital association (nyvca) hosts annual summits to educate those interested in learning more about fintech. in 2018 alone, fintech was responsible for over 1,700 deals worth over 40 billion dollars. in 2021, one in every five dollars invested by venture capital has gone into fintech. == challenges and solutions == in addition to established competitors, fintech companies often face doubts from financial regulators like issuing banks and national governments. in july 2018, the trump administration in the united states issued a policy statement that allowed fintech companies to apply for special purpose national bank charters from the federal office of the comptroller of the currency. federal preemption applies to state law regarding federally chartered banks.data security is another issue regulators are concerned about because of the threat of hacking as well as the need to protect sensitive consumer and corporate financial data. leading global fintech companies are proactively turning to cloud technology to meet increasingly stringent compliance regulations.the federal trade commission provides free resources for corporations of all sizes to meet their legal obligations of protecting sensitive data. several private initiatives suggest that multiple layers of defense can help isolate and secure financial data.in the european union, fintech companies must adhere to data protection laws, such as gdpr. companies need to proactively protect users and companies data or face fines of 20 million euros, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of their total global turnover. in addition to gdpr, european financial institutions including fintech firms have to update their regulatory affairs departments with the payment services directive (psd2), meaning they must organise their revenue structure around a central goal of privacy.any data breach, no matter how small, can result in direct liability to a company (see the gramm–leach–bliley act) and ruin a fintech company's reputation.the online financial sector is also an increasing target of distributed denial of service extortion attacks. this security challenge is also faced by historical bank companies since they do offer internet-connected customer services.many fintech technologies have very high start-up costs but very low marginal costs for adding additional customers, effectively necessitating many fintech companies to act as natural monopolies. == european regulation on fintechs == european regulation on fintechs refers to the body of laws, directives, and guidelines that govern the operation, development, and innovation of financial technology (fintech) companies in the european union (eu). as the fintech sector has rapidly evolved in recent years, the european commission and european parliament have introduced various regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability, promote innovation, and protect consumer interests. these frameworks aim to create a single market for fintech services, while also addressing the emerging risks and challenges associated with new financial technologies. == see also == artificial intelligence in finance fintech in australia smart contract

      "swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.swimming is a popular recreational activity and competitive sport that involves moving through water using various techniques. it offers numerous health benefits and is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels. swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum. as a formalized sport, swimming is featured in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern summer olympics. swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes in order to propel the body forward. while the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest of the four main strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as training. mainly because of the aquatic environment where it takes place, swimming comes with certain risks. by way of example, swimmers may find themselves incapacitated by panic and exhaustion, both potential causes of death by drowning. other dangers may arise from exposure to infection or to hostile aquatic fauna. to minimize such eventualities, most facilities employ a lifeguard to keep alert for any signs of distress. swimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the culture of the area, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire. in addition to this, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels. == science == swimming relies on the nearly neutral buoyancy of the human body. on average, the body has a relative density of 0.98 compared to water, which causes the body to float. however, buoyancy varies on the basis of body composition, lung inflation, muscle and fat content, centre of gravity and the salinity of the water. higher levels of body fat and saltier water both lower the relative density of the body and increase its buoyancy. human males tend to have a lower centre of gravity and higher muscle content, therefore find it more difficult to float or be buoyant. see also: hydrostatic weighing. since the human body is less dense than water, water is able to support the weight of the body during swimming. as a result, swimming is \"low-impact\" compared to land activities such as running. the density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body. hydrodynamics is important to stroke technique for swimming faster, and swimmers who want to swim faster or exhaust less try to reduce the drag of the body's motion through the water. to be more hydrodynamically effective, swimmers can either increase the power of their strokes or reduce water resistance, though power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance. efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.just before plunging into the pool, swimmers may perform exercises such as squatting. squatting helps in enhancing a swimmer's start by warming up the thigh muscles. == infant swimming == human babies demonstrate an innate swimming or diving reflex from newborn until the age of approximately 6 months. other mammals also demonstrate this phenomenon (see mammalian diving reflex). the diving response involves apnea, reflex bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in other words, babies immersed in water spontaneously hold their breath, slow their heart rate, and reduce blood circulation to the extremities (fingers and toes). because infants are innately able to swim, classes for babies of about 6 months old are offered in many locations. this helps build muscle memory and makes strong swimmers from a young age. == technique == swimming can be undertaken using a wide range of styles, known as 'strokes,' and these strokes are used for different purposes, or to distinguish between classes in competitive swimming. it is not necessary to use a defined stroke for propulsion through the water, and untrained swimmers may use a 'doggy paddle' of arm and leg movements, similar to the way four-legged animals swim. there are four main strokes used in competition and recreation swimming: the front crawl, also known as freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly. competitive swimming in europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke. in 1873, john arthur trudgen introduced the trudgen to western swimming competitions. butterfly was developed in the 1930s, and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953. butterfly is considered the hardest stroke by many people, but it is the most effective for all-around toning and the building of muscles. it also burns the most calories and can be the second fastest stroke if practiced regularly.in non-competitive swimming, there are some swimming strokes including sidestroke. the sidestroke toward the end of the 19th century, this pattern was changed by raising one arm above the water first, then the other, and then each in turn. it is still used in lifesaving and recreational swimming. other strokes exist for particular reasons such as training, school lessons, and rescue, and it is often possible to change strokes to avoid using parts of the body, either to separate specific body parts, such as swimming with only arms or legs to exercise them harder, or for amputees or those affected by paralysis. == history == swimming has been recorded since prehistoric times, and the earliest records of swimming date back to stone age paintings from around 7,000 years ago. written references date from 2000 bce. some of the earliest references include the epic of gilgamesh, the iliad, the odyssey, the bible (ezekiel 47:5, acts 27:42, isaiah 25:11), beowulf, and other sagas. the coastal tribes living in the volatile low countries were known as excellent swimmers by the romans. men and horses of the batavi tribe could cross the rhine without losing formation, according to tacitus. dio cassius describes one surprise tactic employed by aulus plautius against the celts at the battle of the medway: the [british celts] thought that romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of [batavii], who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. ... thence the britons retired to the river thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. this they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found, but the romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. however, the [batavii] swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them. in 1538, nikolaus wynmann, a swiss–german professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (the swimmer, or a dialogue on the art of swimming and joyful and pleasant to read). == purpose == there are many reasons why people swim, from swimming as a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity. swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries. people may also pursue swimming as a career or field of interest. some may be gifted and choose to compete professionally and go on to claim fame. === recreation === many swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to take part in. recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation or rehabilitation. the support of the water, and the reduction in impact, makes swimming accessible for people who are unable to undertake activities such as running. swimming is one of the most relaxing activities, water is known to calm us and can help reduce stress. === health === swimming is primarily a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply to the muscles, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically. furthermore, swimming can help tone and strengthen muscles. regular swimming can help in weight management and contribute to maintaining a healthy body weight. (robinson 2022) swimming allows sufferers of arthritis to exercise affected joints without worsening their symptoms. swimming is often recommended for individuals with joint conditions or injuries, as the buoyancy of water reduces stress on the joints. however, swimmers with arthritis may wish to avoid swimming breaststroke, as improper technique can exacerbate arthritic knee pain. as with most aerobic exercise, swimming reduces the harmful effects of stress. swimming is also effective in improving health for people with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses. it is proven to positively impact the mental health of pregnant women and mothers. swimming can even improve mood. although many forms of physical activity have been shown to improve bone density and health, this is where swimming has its downfalls. due to the low-impact nature of the sport, studies have demonstrated that bone mass acquisition will be negatively impacted, which could be an issue for adolescent athletes in particular. ==== disabled swimmers ==== since 2010, the americans with disabilities act has required that swimming pools in the united states be accessible to disabled swimmers. ==== elderly swimmers ==== \"water-based exercise can benefit older adults by improving quality of life and decreasing disability. it also improves or maintains the bone health of post-menopausal women.\" swimming is an ideal workout for the elderly, as it is a low-impact sport with very little risk of injury. exercise in the water works out all muscle groups, helping with conditions such as muscular dystrophy which is common in seniors. it is also a common way to relieve pain from arthritis. === sport === swimming as a sport predominantly involves participants competing to be the fastest over a given distance in a certain period of time. competitors swim different distances in different levels of competition. for example, swimming has been an olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four main strokes and medley. during the season competitive swimmers typically train multiple times per day and week to increase endurance, strength, and preserve fitness. furthermore when the cycle of work is completed swimmers go through a stage called taper where intensity is reduced in preparation for competition season. during taper, focus is on power and water feel. the sport is governed internationally by the fédération internationale de natation (fina), and competition pools for fina events are 25 or 50 meters in length. in the united states, a pool 25 yards in length is commonly used for competition. other swimming and water-related sporting disciplines include open water swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, water polo, triathlon, and the modern pentathlon. === safety === it is important to prioritize safety when swimming. this includes having lifeguards present, swimming in designated areas, and being aware of potential hazards such as currents and underwater obstacles. as a popular leisure activity done all over the world, one of the primary risks of swimming is drowning. drowning may occur from a variety of factors, from swimming fatigue to simply inexperience in the water. from 2005 to 2014, an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings occurred in the united states, approximating 10 deaths a day.to minimize the risk and prevent potential drownings from occurring, lifeguards are often employed to supervise swimming locations such as pools, waterparks, lakes and beaches. different lifeguards receive different training depending on the sites that they are employed at; i.e. a waterfront lifeguard receives more rigorous training than a poolside lifeguard. well-known aquatic training services include the national lifesaving society and the canadian red cross, which specialize in training lifeguards in north america. learning basic water safety skills, such as swimming with a buddy and knowing how to respond to emergencies, is essential for swimmers of all levels. === occupation === some occupations require workers to swim, such as abalone and pearl diving, and spearfishing. swimming is used to rescue people in the water who are in distress, including exhausted swimmers, non-swimmers who have accidentally entered the water, and others who have come to harm on the water. lifeguards or volunteer lifesavers are deployed at many pools and beaches worldwide to fulfil this purpose, and they, as well as rescue swimmers, may use specific swimming styles for rescue purposes. swimming is also used in marine biology to observe plants and animals in their natural habitat. other sciences use swimming; for example, konrad lorenz swam with geese as part of his studies of animal behavior. swimming also has military purposes. military swimming is usually done by special operation forces, such as navy seals and us army special forces. swimming is used to approach a location, gather intelligence, engage in sabotage or combat, and subsequently depart. this may also include airborne insertion into water or exiting a submarine while it is submerged. due to regular exposure to large bodies of water, all recruits in the united states navy, marine corps, and coast guard are required to complete basic swimming or water survival training. swimming is also a professional sport. companies sponsor swimmers who have the skills to compete at the international level. many swimmers compete competitively to represent their home countries in the olympics. professional swimmers may also earn a living as entertainers, performing in water ballets. === locomotion === locomotion by swimming over brief distances is frequent when alternatives are precluded. there have been cases of political refugees swimming in the baltic sea and of people jumping in the water and swimming ashore from vessels not intended to reach land where they planned to go. == risks == there are many risks associated with voluntary or involuntary human presence in water, which may result in death directly or through drowning asphyxiation. swimming is both the goal of much voluntary presence and the prime means of regaining land in accidental situations. most recorded water deaths fall into these categories: panic occurs when an inexperienced swimmer or a nonswimmer becomes mentally overwhelmed by the circumstances of their immersion, leading to sinking and drowning. occasionally, panic kills through hyperventilation, even in shallow water. exhaustion can make a person unable to sustain efforts to swim or tread water, often leading to death through drowning. an adult with fully developed and extended lungs has generally positive or at least neutral buoyancy, and can float with modest effort when calm and in still water. a small child has negative buoyancy and must make a sustained effort to avoid sinking rapidly. hypothermia, in which a person loses critical core temperature, can lead to unconsciousness or heart failure. dehydration from prolonged exposure to hypertonic salt water—or, less frequently, salt water aspiration syndrome where inhaled salt water creates foam in the lungs that restricts breathing—can cause loss of physical control or kill directly without actual drowning. hypothermia and dehydration also kill directly, without causing drowning, even when the person wears a life vest. blunt trauma in a fast moving flood or river water can kill a swimmer outright, or lead to their drowning.adverse effects of swimming can include: exostosis, an abnormal bony overgrowth narrowing the ear canal due to frequent, long-term splashing or filling of cold water into the ear canal, also known as surfer's ear infection from water-borne bacteria, viruses, or parasites chlorine inhalation (in swimming pools) heart attacks while swimming (the primary cause of sudden death among triathlon participants, occurring at the rate of 1 to 2 per 100,000 participations.) adverse encounters with aquatic life: stings from sea lice, jellyfish, fish, seashells, and some species of coral puncture wounds caused by crabs, lobsters, sea urchins, zebra mussels, stingrays, flying fish, sea birds, and debris hemorrhaging bites from fish, marine mammals, and marine reptiles, occasionally resulting from predation venomous bites from sea snakes and certain species of octopus electrocution or mild shock from electric eels and electric raysaround any pool area, safety equipment is often important, and is a zoning requirement for most residential pools in the united states. supervision by personnel trained in rescue techniques is required at most competitive swimming meets and public pools. == lessons == traditionally, children were considered not able to swim independently until 4 years of age, although now infant swimming lessons are recommended to prevent drowning.in sweden, denmark, norway, estonia and finland, the curriculum for the fifth grade (fourth grade in estonia) states that all children should learn to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water. most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim 200 metres (660 ft)—of which at least 50 metres (160 ft) on their back – after first falling into deep water and getting their head under water. even though about 95 percent of swedish school children know how to swim, drowning remains the third most common cause of death among children.in both the netherlands and belgium swimming lessons under school time (schoolzwemmen, school swimming) are supported by the government. most schools provide swimming lessons. there is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the netherlands and belgium, the dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is even schoolslag (schoolstroke). in france, swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools. children usually spend one semester per year learning swimming during cp/ce1/ce2/cm1 (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade). in many places, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies. many schools also include swimming lessons into their physical education curricula, provided either in the schools' own pool or in the nearest public pool. in the uk, the \"top-ups scheme\" calls for school children who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons. children who have not reached great britain's national curriculum standard of swimming 25 meters by the time they leave primary school receive a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.in canada and mexico there has been a call to include swimming in public school curriculum.in the united states there is the infant swimming resource (isr) initiative that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with an emergency where they have fallen into the water. they are taught how to roll-back-to-float (hold their breath underwater, to roll onto their back, to float unassisted, rest and breathe until help arrives), while clothed and unclothed. in isr they teach the children how to roll with their clothes on, as a simulation, if they were to actually fall in walking or crawling by. in switzerland, swimming lessons for babies are popular, to help them getting used to be in another element. at the competition level, unlike in other countries - such as the commonwealth countries, swimming teams are not related to educational institutions (high-schools and universities), but rather to cities or regions. == clothing and equipment == === swimsuits === standard everyday clothing is usually impractical for swimming and is unsafe under some circumstances. most cultures today expect swimmers to wear swimsuits. men's swimsuits commonly resemble shorts, or briefs. men's casual swimsuits (for example, boardshorts) are rarely skintight, unlike competitive swimwear, like jammers or diveskins. in most cases, boys and men swim with their upper body exposed, except in countries where custom or law prohibits it in a public setting, or for practical reasons such as sun protection. modern women's swimsuits are generally skintight, covering the pubic region and the breasts (see bikini). women's swimwear may also cover the midriff as well. women's swimwear is often a fashion statement, and whether it is modest or not is a subject of debate by many groups, religious and secular. competitive swimwear is built so that the wearer can swim faster and more efficiently. modern competitive swimwear is skintight and lightweight. there are many kinds of competitive swimwear for each gender. it is used in aquatic competitions, such as water polo, swim racing, diving, and rowing. wetsuits provide both thermal insulation and flotation. many swimmers lack buoyancy in the leg. the wetsuit provides additional volume at a lower density and therefore improves buoyancy and trim while swimming. it provides insulation between the skin and water which reduces heat loss. the wetsuit is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia. some people also choose to wear no clothing while swimming. in some european countries public pools allow clothes-free swimming and many countries have beaches where one can swim naked. it is legal to swim naked in the sea at all uk beaches. it was common for males to swim naked in a public setting up to the early 20th century. today, swimming naked can be a rebellious activity or merely a casual one. === accessories === ear plugs can prevent water from getting in the ears. noseclips can prevent water from getting in the nose. however, using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause disadvantage, so many competitive swimmer choose not to use one. for this reason, nose clips are primarily used for synchronized swimming and recreational swimming. goggles protect the eyes from chlorinated water, and improve underwater visibility. tinted goggles protect the eyes from sunlight that reflects from the bottom of the pool. swim caps keep the body streamlined and protect the hair from chlorinated water, though they are not entirely watertight. kickboards are used to keep the upper body afloat while exercising the lower body. pull buoys are used to keep the lower body afloat while exercising the upper body. swimfins are used in training to elongate the kick and improve technique and speed. fins also build upper calf muscles. fins provide a significantly greater and more efficient conversion of muscle power to thrust than available from the feet, and allow the powerful leg muscles to be used effectively for propulsion through water. the value of fins as an active aid in the teaching, learning and practice of swimming has long been recognised. in the us, as early as 1947, they were used experimentally to build the confidence of reluctant beginners in swimming, while a 1950 ymca lifesaving and water safety manual reminded swimming instructors how \"flippers can be used to great advantage for treading water, surface diving, towing, underwater searching and supporting a tired swimmer\". in 1967, research was conducted on fin use in teaching the crawl stroke. during the 1970s, the so-called \"flipper-float\" method came into vogue in europe with the aim of helping beginners learn to swim faster and more safely, hand paddles are used to increase resistance during arm movements, with the goal of improving technique and power. finger paddles have a similar effect to handle paddles however due to their smaller size create less resistance. they also help with improving a swimmers 'catch' in the water. snorkels are used to help improve and maintain a good head position in the water. they may also be used by some during physical therapy. pool noodles are used to keep the user afloat during the time in the water. safety fencing and equipment is mandatory at public pools and a zoning requirement at most residential pools in the united states. swimming parachutes are used in competitive training, adding an element of resistance in the water helping athletes to increase power in the strokes central movements. inflatable armbands are swimming aids designed to provide buoyancy for the swimmer which helps the wearer to float. == see also == == references == == bibliography == cox, lynne (2005). swimming to antarctica: tales of a long-distance swimmer. harvest books. isbn 978-0-15-603130-1. maniscalco
